Ming Tribute Grain System,The,,The Ming Tribute Grain System,,"<p class=""Toreview"">Dr. Hoshi's detailed reconstruction of the Ming tribute grain system offers ideas and materials of relevance to several different fields of investigation. To the historian of political institutions it provides a case-study of the workings of a specific branch of the imperial Chinese administration from the highest to the lowest levels over a period of three hundred years. To the economic historian it offers a mine of information on the nature and scale of Chinese and waterway transportation, both as regards the techniques of transport and the flow of goods. To the comparativist seeking insight into the reasons for China's failure to expand overseas in the manner of early modern Europe it gives a new perspective on the withdrawal of the Ming government from the sea: the perfection of inland waterway transport made it necessary to maintain a strong naval capacity to provide and protect the shipping that carried northwards the Court's supplies of grain. To the military historian it reveals something of the foundations of that extraordinary logistical capability that helped to keep the Chinese empire together and to prevent the fragmentation and erosion that befell Western Europe and Byzantium respectively. Such, however, is the careful objectivity of the work that, for the most part, the reader is left to ask his own questions and draw his own conclusions.

Japanese scholars have been the pioneers in opening up this field, and Professor Shiba's <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">Commerce and Society in Sung China</i> is among the most recent and most impressive fruits of their labors. For the first time it is possible to be relatively confident, as the result of the author's systematic exploitation of an enormous range of source materials, about the parts played by transport, trade, business organization and urbanization in this revolution. It is hardly necessary to labor the significance of the advance. China's was beyond any reasonable doubt the most developed economy in the medieval world, and the investigation both of the causes that made this possible and of those that subsequently prevented a take-off into sustained growth is among the most pressing tasks waiting to be accomplished before any general theory of economic development, solidly grounded in comparative historical analysis, becomes possible.

By the early nineteenth century there were almost 25,000 of them, and pawnbroking yielded a higher rate of return on investment than did land. The Ch'ing also saw this industry in decline, its exponential growth a victim of the Taiping Rebellion and rapidly developing Shansi banks. Yet, in republican times the pawnshop was still common in city and countryside alike. Furthermore, it was to live on after Liberation. But when the People's Bank of China opened Citizens' Petty Loan Offices in the early 1950s in order to furnish workers and peasant with low-interest loans, and when the transformation of private enterprise occurred in 1956, the last of the pawnbrokers, holding out in urban areas such as Shanghai, were forced to close their doors, and the pawnshop ceased to exist on the mainland. Its life had spanned almost fifteen hundred years. On Taiwan, however, the institution survives—there were 750 pawnshops on the island in 1974—as it does in most overseas Chinese communities.

These three painters, each important in his own time and deemed a master by later critics, were all concerned with the subjective in the objective world. In Chinese painting there is no clear desire to separate these two realms; rather, there is a constant, conscious play between the physical reality of the world and the subjective vision of the artist. The artist is continually imitating the world—sometimes more, sometimes less—but he never denies its appearance to the point of total abstraction; nor, in the other extreme, does he claim for the physical world an existence independent of his own involvement.</p>",160,2,UM Center for Chinese Studies,Michigan Classics in Chinese Studies

The campaign was not one of the most consequential in China's military history, even during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). But it was famous and well reported in its time, and it illustrates some of the unusual ways in which the Chinese of the imperial age coped with the often unusual military problems they faced.</p> <p class=""Toreview"">Su-chou and the agents of Wei Chung-hsien, 1626.

Unfortunately, it is also a very confusing period, full of shifts and changes in economic, social, and political organizations. The social implications of these changes, and the relationships between officials on the subdistrict level, the unofficial leaders, and the bulk of the peasantry remain inadequately known. South China, which nurtured the Communist Party in its formative years, is a particularly interesting case. In this study I use the Kuan lineage of K'ai-p'ing as a case study to show the effects of demographic, economic, administrative, and educational changes after the Treaty of Nanking (1842) on patrilineal kinship as a principle of social organization in South China.

The function of the ""proletariat"" in the complex of policy issues and leadership struggles which developed under the precarious circumstances of those years had an importance out of all proportion to labor's relatively minor role in the post-1927 Communist led revolution.

As such, it was a vital link in the control of a vast empire by a very small and alien ruling elite. This is primarily a biographical and statistical analysis of the incumbents of that office. By analyzing the biographical data of those who held the position of governor-general, much may be learned about the nature of the office itself. However, the main objective of the study is to provide information on career patterns, that is, the variety of different posts held from the first official appointment to that of governor-general, of an important cross section of successful Ch'ing bureaucrats. By plotting and analyzing the different patterns their official careers took, we should be able to determine what kind of men reached the top of China's provincial and national administration during the final centuries of China's imperial history; the qualifications that were required; the factors which prompted rapid promotion or sudden disgrace. We should also be able to determine the extent to which these and other factors varied markedly among Manchu, Mongol, Chinese Bannerman, and Han incumbents and whether changes throughout the dynasty can be detected in policies concerning the office or in the career patterns of its personnel. If such detection is possible, this study may lend support to the view that late imperial China was not static, but a society undergoing significant changes.

Individualism and Holism,,Studies in Confucian and Taoist Values,Individualism and Holism: Studies in Confucian and Taoist Values,"<p class=""Keynote"">Fifteen essays addressing conceptions of individualism and holism as they emerged in Chinese literature and philosophy from the time of Confucius and Chuang-tzu to the present</p>","<p class=""Toreview"">The notion of ""individualism"" inevitably creeps into the conversation of Americans who try to compare their country with China. It is something we supposedly have and prize which the Chinese do not now have nor probably ever had. For several generations, noncommunists and communists in China have excoriated individualism as the equivalent of selfishness. For them it is a morally insupportable value, not least because it is thought to fragment societies. Inasmuch as the word ""individualism"" defines a number of different, though related, value concepts in modern usage, the point of departure for our analysis will be the examination of each of these. This approach will enable us to judge exactly what it is we were supposed to have, whether or not the concept has played a role in Chinese society, past or present, and, if so, what significance has been attached to it.</p> <p class=""Toreview"">The word ""holism"" rarely creeps into anyone's conversation, except, perhaps, that of the sociologist or philosopher. It is a scholarly word. Yet there is considerable overlap between lay remarks about individual interest being subordinate to group interest and the scholar's technical descriptions of what some holisms expect of people. The ideas suggested by the term are not exclusively scholarly. It seems to point to some Chinese ways of thinking about relations among individuals that contrast with our ways. But if anything, it is vaguer than ""individualism."" [1]</p>",416,52,UM Center for Chinese Studies,Michigan Monographs in Chinese Studies

Today, however, thanks in no small measure to the pioneering work of Professor Tai, the Red Spears have gained a secure niche in scholarship on modern China. Their numbers (reaching perhaps some three million participants at the height of the movement) and enduring (lasting intermittently for several decades) should stand as reason enough for the recent scholarly attention. </p> <p class=""Toreview"">But the Red Spears have generated interest for other reasons as well. As research has developed into the history both of China's traditional rural rebellions and of her Communist revolution has developed over the past few years, the Red Spears have assumed increasing significance. A movement which bore marked similarities to earlier Chinese uprisings (most notably the Boxers), the Red Spears nevertheless operated in a later period of history (right through the middle of the twentieth century) which brought them in direct contact with Communist revolutionaries. An analysis of the Red Spears thus becomes important both for what it can tell us about longstanding patterns of rural rebellion in China, and for what it suggests about the nature of Chinese revolution.</p>",,54,UM Center for Chinese Studies,Michigan Monographs in Chinese Studies

The first, a workshop on ""The Pursuit of Interest in China,"" was held in August 1977 at the University of Michigan, and was organized by Michel Oksenberg and Richard Baum. It was supported by a grant from the Joint Committee on Contemporary China of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, using funds provided by the Andrew Mellon Foundation. Its principal goal was to use detailed case studies to explore the relevance of interest group approaches to the study of Chinese politics. The second, a panel organized by the editor for the 1978 Chicago meeting of the Association of Asian Studies, sought to apply participatory approaches to the role of social groups in the Chinese political process. The striking degree of overlap in the focus, methodology, and participants in both meetings suggested to a number of the paper writers that there was a need for a more eclectic approach which would focus simultaneously on individual and group actors. The recognition that a volume based on such an approach might serve the needs of students and scholars seeking to examine the dynamics of informal influence and power in China was the stimulus for publishing the studies presented here in book form.

Each one has contributed in significant ways both to the scholarship in their disciplines and to the development of the China field as a whole. These four, whose names long ago became virtually synonymous with the Center—Donald Munro in Philosophy, Albert Feuerwerker in History, Norma Diamond in Anthropology, and Robert F. Dernberger in Economics—reached retirement age in the past two years. Current Center faculty and former students wished to convey their gratitude for the contributions these four have made to their lives and their field of work over the decades.</p> <p class=""Toreview"">No single effort can hope to capture entire careers. Instead of attempting such an ambitious goal, the symposium ""Constructing China"" reflected the kind of intellectually exciting event which always delighted the four honorees. In tribute to them, the Center, with support from the University's International Institute, convened a two-day conference from 31 March to 1 April 1995, around the broad theme of the interaction of culture and development in modern China. This conclave brought together the extended Center community—including noted graduates as well as current faculty. This volume presents the symposium papers, along with substantive introductions for each group of papers written by the respective retirees. The essays range across a wide intellectual landscape, reflecting the breadth of scholarship that the four honorees have nurtured.

Mao's Revolution and the Chinese Political Culture,,,Mao's Revolution and the Chinese Political Culture,"<p class=""Keynote"">Plumbs the life of one of the twentieth century's most influential political leaders in his personal struggle to adapt the weighty cultural inheritance of mankind to the political and economic challenges of a new era</p>","<p class=""Toreview"">The career of Mao Tse-tung, from his early years as a student revolutionary in Hunan Province to his rise to leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and, after 1949, Chairmanship of the People's Republic, has been intimately related to the efforts of the Chinese people to transform their ancient society into a modern nation. This book explores Mao's gradual development of a new style of politics and social organization over three decades of power-conflict, followed by the struggle to institutionalize his concepts in post-Liberation China.</p> <p class=""Toreview"">Most previous studies of China's efforts to enter the modern world have focused on the revolution of the country's historical institutions, on the ferment of new ideas and social values in a society which for thousands of years has had a highly developed intellectual tradition, and on the efforts to transform a peasant society into an industrializing nation-state. Here we explore a different aspect of the story. It is our basic assumption that China's difficulties in responding to the changing world of the past century have been largely cultural and psychological in quality rather than institutional or economic. Mao Tse-tung began his political career in the period of cultural challenge of the late 1910s and early 1920s known as the ""May Fourth"" era. He is concluding his career with a ""Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,"" an astounding effort which began in the mid-1960s to confront once again what he and his Red Guard supporters called China's ""four olds""—her traditional customs, habits, culture, and social thought. </p> <p class=""Toreview"">Thus there is an important tension between Mao Tse-tung's personal conception of how China's political and social life should be organized in the country's search for new greatness, and the endurance of old social attitudes and political habits of millions of Chinese who embody the legacy of China's past.

Lord Lao appears in eight distinct mythical roles, each associated with a particular phase in his life: He is the creator of the universe, bringer of cosmic order, teacher of dynasties, and the divine made flesh on earth. He is also the converter of the barbarians, the source of major Daoist revelations, and the god of Great Peace and political harmony.

While the idea of a federated state was cherished by early revolutionaries, a growing conflict between federalist and centralist leaders culminated in the defeat of federalism in the mid–1920s.

It describes Chen's role in the tumultuous politics of southern China from 1909 until his death in 1933, including his relationship and notorious break with Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the centralist revolutionaries. Leslie Chen argues that his father's attempts to create a democratic, federalist system in Guangdong were aimed at providing a model for China as a whole.

He concludes that the sources of tension lay with day-to-day problems common throughout rural China, rather than with issues of religion per se. Although religious identity did play a role in local conflict during this forty-year period, personal or family disputes, poverty, and general alienation turn out to be equally important factors.</p> <p class=""Toreview"">Earlier scholarship on urban anti-Christian incidents pointed to agitation by local elites against aggressive missionaries and the enclaving of Chinese Christians apart from their communities, yet this author's findings suggest that Catholics in rural Jiangxi were normally well integrated into their larger communities, and conflict with Catholics was more often a contest of personal interests among neighbors.</p>",296,91,UM Center for Chinese Studies,Michigan Monographs in Chinese Studies

In place of the episodic tale of fantastic adventures so popular with nineteenth-century Japanese readers, Futabatei presented a story with the simplest plot. The whole novel hinges on the fact that the hero, Utsumi Bunzo, has lost his post in the lowest ranks of the government bureaucracy. As a consequence, he finds that his marriage to his cousin, Osei, which had been virtually assured, has now become impossible. Osei's affections soon turn to Bunzo's former college, the up-and-coming Honda Noboru. Futabatei tells his entire story within the confines of this plot. There are only four main characters—Bunzo, Noboru, Osei, and Osei's mother, Omasa—and a few minor characters. It was Futabatei's intention to picture the nature of his society through these characters; to demonstrate by means of the words and actions of his characters the effect of Meiji life on Japanese society.</p>",396,1,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Classics in Japanese Studies

After 1910, when he very nearly died from stomach ulcers, he seems to have felt that death was not far away. He wrote the novel in 1915, when he was forty-eight; the following year, before he could complete Light and Darkness (Meian), he died. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The period dealt with in Grass on the Wayside is very short. It begins soon after the author's return from London in 1903 and ends as his career as a writer is about to begin. (I am a Cat was published in 1905). Kenzo (the name Soseki gives himself) is at this time in his middle thirties, and his wife in her middle twenties. It was then, presumably, that relations between Soseki and his wife became strained and he began to be acutely conscious of his loneliness. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The novel has its shortcomings. It is not devoid of self-pity or naïveté, and it is so introspective that the reader may find it at times rather slow-moving. Nevertheless, it is all in his most serious work.

First, and obviously, it will help the reader gain a deeper understanding of Japanese literature and art. By learning about the philosophies of art in Japan, they will come to know the aims and methods with which the Japanese produced paintings, music, plays, novels and poems. As it happens, many of the major Japanese aestheticians were also great artists, so the person who carefully examines their theories of art will be rewarded with a glimpse into the secret of their creative achievements too. In this respect it is rather strange that Japanese aesthetics still remains a neglected subject in the West, where there is an increasing interesting Japanese art. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Secondly, an examination of Japanese aesthetic ideas will contribute towards an international definition of art. Since ancient times numerous attempts have been made to answer the questions ""What is art?"" or ""What is literature?""; yet in almost every case the answer has been formulated within a single cultural tradition. A definition of art that makes any claim to universality must be applicable to all arts, Oriental or Western. Japanese theories of art, which developed independently of Western culture, may provide a convenient touchstone by which to test the universal validity of a Western aesthetic concept.

But (even if children slept regularly ten hours a day) that still leaves some 65,000 waking hours between the ages of two and sixteen which they will spend with family and neighborhood children. And those hours are immensely important-- not perhaps for learning the facts of geography and history or even the rules of addition and subtractions-- but for learning the more important things-- learning to describe and summarize, caring for accuracy and order; to abstract and generalize, proceeding from particulars of seed-corn and gold bangles to the general categories of investment and insurance; to hold future possibilities in mind and compare them with those of the present, assessing the possibilities of jam tomorrow against visible access to jam today; to string a series of 'if x then y' propositions together to relate means to ends, working out how much fertilizer to use to get the best harvest or how worthwhile it would be to accept the constraints of a cooperative; to emphasize, to imagine, what it would be like to be someone else and how that someone else might react to what you're proposing to do-- for learning, in short, to react to the environment with calculation, rules and principles, not just with immediate unrestrained impulse.

Composed perhaps a century after the refined, allusive, aristocratic ""Tale of Genji"", ""Konjaku"", representing a masculine outlook and comparatively plebeian social orientation, stands in piquant contrast to the earlier masterpiece. The unknown compiler was interested less in exploring psychological subtleties than in presenting vivid portraits of human foibles and eccentricities.

Rich in psychological detail, these distinguished stories chronicle the profound changes that altered the fact of postwar Japanese society, as suddenly women were freed from their traditional roles and achieved new rights—with a baffling new set of contradictory demands. Here in the works of such talented authors as Enchi Fumiko, Kōno Taeko, Kurahashi Yumiko, and others—many of whom are translated into English for the first time—we find stories about Japanese women as single mothers, as disillusioned and doubting lovers, as women questioning their marriages and their lives. This Kind of Woman not only breaks new literary ground, but provides a crystal-clear window on the transformations that have altered modern Japanese society. [GR]</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The ten stories in this anthology were published between 1960 and 1976 and were chosen not only for their high quality but also because they show the experiences, thoughts, and feelings of a variety of women whose lives reflect the changes in Japanese society. These stories display a wide range of female experience: some are tinged with respect for traditional ideals, some with a tone of protest, and some with a new element of search. Although the role of ""good wife and wise mother"" may persist as an ideal, the stories in this anthology show that Japanese women have as many conflicting emotions, frustrations, and questions-- and as much anger-- as women in other countries who are trying to adapt to new freedoms and understand what it means to be female.

It seeks historical depth both by limiting the study in terms of its geographical scope and by restricting the number of variables to which it gives attention. This book deals chiefly with the combination of traditions and techniques by which the Japanese organized power and exercised authority and the connections between the holders of power and the sources of wealth, mainly land. Thus, Government and Local Power in Japan deals with such subjects as theories of legitimacy and practices of administration, concepts of social stratification and social rights, and practices of land tenure and taxation.

Historians have ignored the settled conditions of most samurai and instead concentrated on the study of the minority of activist samurai leaders who, with the backing of only a few Han (feudal domains) sought to overthrow the old order and whose success in doing so has made the study of the modernization of Japan the prime concern of historians. The history of the Meiji period may have been an overall political and industrial success story, but for a fuller understanding of the conditions of that success it is also necessary to understand ""what it was really like"" for the members of the old elite to be estranged from the proponents of revolution and what many members did to assure their own social and psychological position in a world they had not expected.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">In this book the author attempts to show that the impact of the Meiji Restoration destroyed the meaningfulness of the Confucian doctrine for these declasse samurai. Through Christianity, the samurai attempted to revive their status in society by finding a doctrine that offered a meaningful path to power. But in doing so, they had to accept a new theory of social relations. Ultimately, as the convert's understanding of society became totally informed by the Christian doctrine, they accepted a transcendent authority that brought them into conflict with society about them. Therefore, to understand the development of a Christian opposition in Meiji society we must begin with the conversion experience itself.

Avatars of Vengeance,,Japanese Drama and the Soga Literary Tradition,Avatars of Vengeance: Japanese Drama and the Soga Literary Tradition,"<p class=""Keynote"">An exploration of the timeless appeal that the Soga story has exerted and the processes that took the brothers through successive incarnations in literature</p>","<p class=""Bkdesc"">For six centuries the Soga vendetta was Japan's archetypal revenge tragedy, and the Soga brothers epitomized heroic avengers, dedicated yet doomed. In <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Avatars of Vengeance</i> Laurence Kominz presents the grand panorama of this saga. It began in 1193 with a politically unimportant assassination, but the murder so captured the imagination of the Japanese that, by the fourteenth century, wandering minstrels throughout the nation were reciting highly embellished oral tales of the vendetta. The most dramatic versions of the Soga story were created for the stage—Noh, kowakamai, puppet theater, and Kabuki. Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Japan's greatest playwright revitalized the tradition in his thirteen Soga plays (1683-1718), and by the mid-eighteenth century the Soga story had become the most popular subject for Kabuki plays in Edo, plays that linked religious rituals and secular entertainment in new ways. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Avatars of Vengeance</i> explores the timeless appeal that the Soga story has exerted on the Japanese and describes the processes that took the brothers through successive incarnations in literature. Beginning as loyal samurai, they changed into Shinto gods, then exemplars of filial virtue, suave dandies, superhuman swashbucklers, sensitive lovers, and back into gods again. The heroines of the story also underwent changes, from exemplars of religious devotion in the medieval, oral tale to icons of romantic love and models of secular virtue in later versions. The most startling transformations in the Soga story and its characters took place on stage as theater changed and developed, fueled by the tastes of succeeding generations of audiences and new methods of stage presentation, by advances in performers' training and technique, and by changing religious attitudes toward the Soga deities. Kominz explains why plays about the Soga revenge so often marked new directions in dramaturgy and play writing. His study demonstrates that no dramatic theme better illuminates the dynamics of creativity in traditional Japanese theater than the Soga vendetta.</p>",296,13,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, one of the most courtly of shoguns, was in firm control of the government, in the Kyoto area at least, and Kaneyoshi's own father was serving as imperial regent. In succeeding years, however, the court and its families were severely tested by political, economic, and social exigencies beyond their control. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The response of some to the turbulence of the world around them was to withdraw into seclusion; Kaneyoshi, as the head of one of the five houses of the regency, seems never to have considered that option. Instead, he dedicated himself totally to the active maintenance of his heritage. In his early years, this meant competing for office with colleagues at court, providing for a large family and supporting the cause of courtly art and ceremony with his position, his influence, and his resources, both literal and symbolic. Later, when the continued existence of the imperial court and its families was put in jeopardy by events such as the Ōnin War (1467-77), Kaneyoshi dedicated himself to a number of ""conservative"" tasks—from the writing of commentaries and handbooks to the instruction of the shogun in how to return the nation to order. Still, he remained active in political affairs, never losing hope in an eventual resurgence in the fortunes of the court. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Throughout, this story is told through reference to primary sources, most prominently Sino-Japanese (<i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">kanbun</i>) journals left by Kaneyoshi's contemporaries and his own writings.

Through examples from American and British poetry, Rabson also shows that this phenomenon of poets changing their views is by no means exclusive to Japan. Exposing the efforts of some Japanese writers after 1945 to conceal or revise their poetry written during World War II, the author discusses assertions by literary critics and historians that poets bear a special ""war responsibility.""</p>",300,17,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

Their marriage ended in divorce, and one of the author's intentions seems to have been to write an anti-romance, one that could be subtitled, ""I married the prince but we did not live happily ever after."" Yet, particularly in the first part of the diary, Michitsuna's Mother is drawn to record those events and moments when the marriage did live up to a romantic ideal fostered by the Japanese tradition of love poetry. At the same time, she also seems to seek the freedom to live and write outside the romance myth and without a husband.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Since the author was by inclination and talent a poet and lived in a time when poetry was a part of everyday social intercourse, her account of her life is shaped by a lyrical consciousness.

Her renown derives principally from the passion of her early poetry and from her contributions to 20th-century debates about women. This emphasis obscures a major part of her career, which was devoted to work on the Japanese classics and, in particular, the great Heian period text <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">The Tale of Genji</i>.

Believing in beauty and truth and in language's mystical evocation of experience, Kyōka sought for a way to reinvest the world with a kind of magic that he felt was being lost.

Consonantal vocalization, the vowel system of Middle Korean, and competing hypotheses about the origins of the Korean vowel system and the pitch accent system of Middle Korean are addressed.

In <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Dances with Sheep</i>, Matthew Strecher examines Murakami's fiction—and, to a lesser extent, his nonfiction—for its most prevalent structures and themes. Strecher also delves into the paradoxes in Murakami's writings that confront critics and casual readers alike. Murakami writes of ""serious"" themes yet expresses them in a relatively uncomplicated style that appeals to high school students as well as scholars; and his fictional work appears to celebrate the pastiche of postmodern expression, yet he rejects the effects of the postmodern on contemporary culture as dangerous.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Strecher's methodology is both historical and cultural as he utilizes four distinct yet interwoven approaches to analyze Murakami's major works: the writer's ""formulaic"" structure with serious themes; his play with magical realism; the intense psychological underpinnings of his literary landscape; and his critique of language and its capacity to represent realities, past and present. <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">Dances with Sheep</i> links each of these approaches with Murakami's critical focus on the fate of individual identity in contemporary Japan. The result is that the simplicity of the Murakami hero, marked by lethargy and nostalgia, emerges as emblematic of contemporary humankind, bereft of identity, direction, and meaning. Murakami's fiction is reconstructed in <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Dances with Sheep</i> as a warning against the dehumanizing effects of late-model capitalism, the homogenization of the marketplace, and the elimination of effective counterculture in Japan.<b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""></b></p>",254,37,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

For instance, crime trial fiction prompted readers to consider the fate of the nation as an extension of the politics of the courtroom. Images of women were used to allegorically represent the nation itself, suffering at the hands of corrupt government, yet comprising a potent force of political righteousness. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">In the final chapters, Mertz examines the relations of these early Meiji works to the canon of modern Japanese literature, demonstrating the self-concealing nature of literary history, and questioning the role of the West as Japan's model for modernity. <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Novel Japan</i> considers major popular writers Kanagaki Robun, Mantei Ōga, Fukuzawa Yukichi, Komuro Angaidō, Miyazaki Muryū, Yamo Ryūkei, Suehiro Tetchō, and Tsubouchi Shōyō, as well as translations from Bulwer-Lytton, Scott, Stepniak, Dumas, Verne, and others.</p>",312,48,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

Did these ""women's words"" actually exist at the very beginnings of the Japanese language? If such words were in fact part of the language, what kinds of attitudes and treatment toward women were inscribed in them? In her endeavor to address these questions, Endō Orie explores Japan's early literary works to discover what they have to say about the Japanese language. Among her most significant conclusions is the finding that ""womanly"" language in Japan was socially mandated and regulated only with the beginning of warrior rule in the Kamakura period. Now, in contemporary Japan, critics charge that women's language has lost its ""womanly"" qualities and has veered perilously close to men's language. However, if we look at the evidence of history, what we may actually be witnessing is a return to the origins of the Japanese language when no sexual distinctions were made between users.</p>",148,57,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

Women were reviled in much of the popular Buddhist rhetoric of medieval Japan, castigated for their ""filthy femininity,"" but their low spiritual status was in fact frequently contested.

Daily Life and Demographics in Ancient Japan,,,Daily Life and Demographics in Ancient Japan,"<p class=""Keynote"">Explores the daily life of the citizens of the lost periods of ancient Japan</p>","<p class=""Bkdesc"">For centuries, scholars have wondered what daily life was like for the common people of Japan, especially for long bygone eras such as the ancient age (700–1150). Using the discipline of historical demography, William Wayne Farris shows that for most of this era, Japan's overall population hardly grew at all, hovering around six million for almost five hundred years. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The reasons for the stable population were complex. Most importantly, Japan was caught up in an East Asian pandemic that killed both aristocrat and commoner in countless numbers every generation. These epidemics of smallpox, measles, mumps, and dysentery decimated the adult population, resulting in wide-ranging social and economic turmoil. Famine recurred about once every three years, leaving large proportions of the populace malnourished or dead. Ecological degradation of central Japan led to an increased incidence of drought and soil erosion. And war led soldiers to murder innocent bystanders in droves. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Under these harsh conditions, agriculture suffered from high rates of field abandonment and poor technological development. Both farming and industry shifted increasingly to labor-saving technologies. With workers at a premium, wages rose. Traders shifted from the use of money to barter. Cities disappeared. The family was an amorphous entity, with women holding high status in a labor-short economy. Broken families and an appallingly high rate of infant mortality were also part of kinship patterns. The average family lived in a cold, drafty dwelling susceptible to fire, wore clothing made of scratchy hemp, consumed meals just barely adequate in the best of times, and suffered from a lack of sanitary conditions that increased the likelihood of disease outbreak. While life was harsh for almost all people from 700 to 1150, these experiences represented investments in human capital that would bear fruit during the medieval epoch (1150–1600).</p>",148,63,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

A new generation of scholars and critics, many of them veterans of 1960s political activism, arose in revolt against the largely positivistic methodologies that had hitherto dominated postwar literary studies. Creatively refashioning approaches taken from the field of linguistics, the new scholarship challenged orthodox interpretations, often introducing new methodologies in the process: structuralism, semiotics, and phenomenological linguistics, among others. The radical changes introduced then continue to reverberate today, shaping the way Japanese literature is studied both at home and abroad. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">The Linguistic Turn in Contemporary Japanese Literary Studies</i> is the first critical study of this revolution to appear in English. It includes translations of landmark essays published in the 1970s and 1980s by such influential figures as Noguchi Takehiko, Kamei Hideo, Mitani Kuniaki, and Hirata Yumi. It also collects nine new essays that reflect critically on the emergence of linguistics-based literary criticism and theory in Japan, exploring both the novel possibilities such theory created and the shortcomings that could not be overcome. Scholars from a variety of disciplines and fields probe the political and intellectual implications of this transformation and explore the exciting new pathways it opened up for the study of modern Japanese literature.</p>",308,68,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

Her work deals with complicated moral and emotional issues of empire and war responsibility that cannot be summed up in simple slogans, which makes it compelling for more than just its considerable beauty. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Japanese today are still grappling with the effects of World War II, and, largely because of the inconsistent and ambivalent actions of the government, they are widely seen as resistant to accepting responsibility for their nation's violent actions against others during the decades of colonialism and war. Yet some individuals, such as Tomiyama, have produced nuanced and reflective commentaries on those experiences, and on the difficulty of disentangling herself from the priorities of the nation despite her lifelong political dissent. Tomiyama's sophisticated visual commentary on Japan's history—and on the global history in which Asia is embedded—provides a compelling guide through the difficult terrain of modern historical remembrance, in a distinctively Japanese voice.</p>",172,69,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

With chapters on public, private, and missionary schools for girls, their students, and teachers, on social and political groups women created, on female employment, and on women's participation in print media, this book offers a new perspective on nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japanese history. Women's founding of and participation in conflicting discourses over the value of women in Meiji public life demonstrate that during this period active and vocal women were everywhere, that they did not meekly submit to the dictates of the government and intellectuals over what women could or should do, and that they were fully integrated in the production of Meiji culture.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Mara Patessio shows that the study of women is fundamental not only in order to understand fully the transformations of the Meiji period, but also to understand how later generations of women could successfully move the battle forward. <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Women and Public Life in Early Meiji Japan</i> is essential reading for all students and teachers of 19th- and early 20th-century Japanese history and is of interest to scholars of women's history more generally.</p>",240,71,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

From reconsidering the roles of outcastes and outlaws, to the provenance of ""Japan (Nihon),"" to the very meaning of writing, Amino offers a powerful critique of the conventional wisdom about Japan's past. Instead of depicting Japan as an isolated island country full of immobile peasants dominated by swaggering warriors and an unbroken line of sacred emperors, he unveils a dynamic history of an archipelago driven by the competition to control trade and movement, in which warlords and aristocrats share the main stage with pirates, courtesans, beggars, and dancing monks. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Written for a nonspecialist audience and standing on a foundation of fifty years of research in a vast and eclectic range of primary sources, Rethinking Japanese History introduces the English reader to one of Japan's most original and provocative historians. Since the 1970s, Amino has inspired readers with his view of Japanese history ""from the sea,"" in which the power politics of the samurai class were contrasted with the countervailing authorities of religious institutions, artisanal groups, and ""lords of the sea"" who enabled the movement of people and goods from the Asian continent to every harbor and village of Japan. In his portraits of an archaic and medieval past permeated with ""places of freedom"" and a grand struggle between ideologies of trade and agriculture, Amino challenged his contemporaries to reconsider not only their understanding of Japan's past, but also its present and future. Rethinking Japanese History calls on us to contemplate seriously the meaning of the deep past in our present day. By challenging the reader to reexamine our presumptions of the past, Amino offers us a chance to reimagine the present.</p>",358,74,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

New maps and information brought by the missionaries and traders to Japan reflected a world that looked very different from the traditional Sino-centric one. These anti-Kirishitan popular narratives meet the challenge of this new world by expelling it and reasserting the conventional three-realms world order, in which Japan plays an influential role. This is done most obviously in the expulsion of the Kirishitan that is narrated in the texts, but it is also achieved on another level by the representation of the Kirishitan as uncouth and very common villains. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Conquering Demons</i> features a new look at anti-Kirishitan works from a literary perspective, examining them in the context of developments in the publishing industry and in the broader discourses on Japan and its many Others in the world.

They played key roles in the operation of networks linking Japan to the rest of the world, and their protection businesses, shipping organizations, and sea tenure practices spread their influence across the waves to the continent, shaping commercial and diplomatic relations with Korea and China. Japan's land-based authorities during this time not only came to accept the autonomy of ""pirates"" but also competed to sponsor sea-lord bands who could administer littoral estates, fight sea battles, protect shipping, and carry trade. In turn, prominent sea-lord families expanded their dominion by shifting their locus of service among several patrons and by appropriating land-based rhetorics of lordship, which forced authorities to recognize them as legitimate lords over sea-based domains. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">By the end of the late medieval period, the ambitions, tactics, and technologies of sea-lord mercenary bands proved integral to the naval dimensions of Japan's sixteenth-century military revolution. Sea lords translated their late medieval autonomy into positions of influence in early modern Japan and helped make control of the seas part of the ideological foundations of the state.</p>",342,76,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies

Contemporary Japanese Budget Politics,,,Contemporary Japanese Budget Politics,,"<p class=""Bkdesc"">This book on the Japanese budgeting system as it works today and as it has evolved over twenty years is written within two frames of reference and with two audiences in mind. The first frame of reference is comparative public policy—in particular, the search for variables of political structure and process which help account for what governments do. Granting that budget systems in advanced mixed-economy countries are fundamentally similar, variations are important and can be compared. In fact, it is similarity which highlights differences and allows us to specify their consequences. I have tried to maintain an international perspective throughout the book, and to include comparisons to budgeting elsewhere where appropriate. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The second frame of reference is contemporary Japan, specifically the study of Japanese organizations and governmental process.

This introductory volume will not attempt to discuss primary sources, pre-modern historical writings, or periodical articles. Such detailed coverage will be left to later volumes which will confine themselves to smaller segments of Japanese history. [vii]</p>",178,,UM Center for Japanese Studies,

This volume is therefore a guide to the literature of the Showa era, which began when the present Japanese emperor ascended to his throne upon the death of his father, Emperor Taisho. The years that have since passed include some of the most exciting times of Japanese history. Following the First World War, liberal, progressive, and even radical ideas flourished in Japan. But as the military, supported by the great financial, industrial, and mercantile combines later condemned as <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">zaibatsu </i>began to gain ascendancy, literature as well as politics became more and more nationalistic. In the words of liberal critics, it fell into a ""dark ravine,"" and it was only in the first years after World War II that it began once more to show its former vitality and diversity. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The first chapter of this work consists of a brief history of twentieth-century Japanese literature, covering in turn the major schools, coteries, and movements associated with the development of several literary genres, namely fiction, drama, the <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">shi</i> or long poem, <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">tanka</i> or 31-syllable poem, and <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">haiku</i> or 17-syllable poem.

Production Materials from The Effects of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,,,Production Materials from The Effects of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,,"<p class=""Bkdesc"">No critic has ever put <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">The Effects of the Atomic Bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki</i> on their list of the greatest documentaries ever made, but this has something to do with how critics define greatness. It would mostly likely make the top of anyone's list of films that people should see at least once in their lifetime—particularly if they come from a country armed with nuclear weaponry. From a certain perspective, this is a mind-numbingly boring science film; from another, it is a horror film that leaves one speechless and trembling. Most filmmakers trying to represent events as extreme as the holocaust or the atomic bombings run up against the specter of the unpresentable. The strange thing about this film is that the filmmakers never make this effort to begin with. They simply describe the two events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the dry language of hard science. Nothing could be more unnerving.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Another reason this film demands attention has to do with the circumstances of its production. Because of the unique situation in the wake of World War II, very few visual records of the atomic bombings were made. Despite the obvious historical importance of the attacks, information about the bombings was highly controlled for both security and for political reasons. This was the only instance when these weapons of mass destruction have been used against other humans, yet our moving image record of the incidents comes exclusively from this film project. If you have ever seen moving images showing the aftermath of atomic warfare—and most people in the world have—then they came from this film.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Considering the nature of the film, its production, and the postwar relationship of America and Japan, it should be no surprise that the histories of this film are contentious and riddled with paranoia, assumptions and guesses—and all driven by postwar suspicion and complicated by a long-suppressed and still-incomplete archive. This small collection consists mostly of documentation from the film's production saved by the American filmmaker, Daniel McGovern. It clears up many of the misunderstandings and mysteries surrounding the production of <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">The Effects of the Atomic Bomb</i>. </p>",,,UM Center for Japanese Studies,

His depictions of the exotic and erotic of Japan are popular with many foreigners, and he is a superb master of the art of storytelling. The purpose of this volume is to provide access to those works of Tanizaki that have been translated into European languages and to facilitate further research on Tanizaki by listing relevant studies on him. The bibliography catalogs in a user-friendly way the translations of Tanizaki's works into various European languages and the scholarly and popular writings about him.

Political Leadership in Contemporary Japan,,,Political Leadership in Contemporary Japan,"<p class=""Keynote"">A collection of essays capturing the state of leadership in postwar Japan</p>","<p class=""Bkdesc"">Those who do not read Japanese seldom have access to analytic studies of the fascinating and surprisingly diverse world of contemporary Japanese political leadership. This volume constitutes a step toward bringing to the English reader some sense of the norms, beliefs, styles, and modes of exercising power of Japanese political leaders and the organizational and political contexts which are changing leadership role expectations. The second volume in this series concentrates more explicitly on leadership recruitment, although the subject is also addressed here.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">All of the essays in this volume highlight specific politicians, while attempting to develop analytic categories to understand the broader significance of these types of leaders. Included are the following: a Liberal Democratic Party prime minister and faction leader (Fukuda Takeo) who rose ""almost effortlessly"" to the pinnacle of power on the basis of an elitist educational and bureaucratic career background and another (Tanaka Kakuei) who took advantage of the chaotic wartime and immediate postwar period to overcome the limitations of his commoner background by developing an entrepreneurial style that makes him even today ""the most powerful in Japan""; a younger conservative leader (Kono Yohei) who, with certain others of his generation, found life within the restrictive but predictable career paths of ruling Liberal Democrats less attractive than the risky option of forming his own New Liberal Club; an unconventional Socialist chairman (Asukata Ichio) who bucks the pull toward coalition making among the opposition parties in favor of his belief that this major but perpetual opposition party must first reconstruct itself and structure a new popular consensus that can legitimize a coalitional alternative to the Liberal Democrats; parliamentary leaders (like lower-house speaker Maeo Shigesaburo, directors of the House Management Committee, and heads of the Diet policy committees of the various parties) who are projected into increasingly influential roles by changing electoral trends and popular expectations; an innovative and dynamic mayor (Suzuki Heizaburo) who, taking advantage of the considerable authority afforded by Japan's ""presidential"" system of local chief executives, pursues his own priorities, mobilizing the requisite support despite the lack of national guidance and the oppositions of former backers; and the ""power behind the throne"" (Matsunaga Yasuzaemon and Komori Takeshi) whose visions move prime ministers and governors as well as their own followers in powerful public and private bureaucracies.

"Parties, Candidates, and Voters in Japan",,Six Quantitative Studies,"Parties, Candidates, and Voters in Japan: Six Quantitative Studies",A serious and interesting study of Japanese politics and elections.,"<p class=""Bkdesc"">The study of voting and behavior associated with voting is the most developed subfield of American political science, in terms of both theoretical elaboration and empirical research. It is quite amenable to cross-national comparison, as much excellent research in Europe indicates. Voting research has also been popular among specialists of Japanese politics.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Japan shares its level of economic development and many institutional structures with Western countries, but the cultural setting-- presumably including political culture-- is distinctive. It thus offers a splendid testing ground for broadening culture-bound theories of political behavior, as well as providing some fascinating puzzles of its own.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The essays collected in this volume deal with several theories and several puzzles. John Strate draws ingeniously on Japanese (and Italian) survey data to construct a fundamental critique of the concept of party identification, that most basic component of American-style research on the voting decision. His paper suggests a new linkage between social change and shifts in party support. Soo Young Auh deals with political participation, another well explored body of theory, but he treats levels of participation as an independent variable which helps explain variations in opinions on issues (including the security treaty and constitutional revision) among party adherents. Tom Rochon's crisp paper finally answers the old question of why Japanese tend to vote ""for the man"" rather than on the basis of party or issue orientation: it is not the personalistic culture, it is the electoral system. All three authors have relied mainly on secondary analysis of the large election survey carried out in 1967 by Robert E. Ward and Akira Kubota.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The other three papers focus on candidates and elections. Jung-Suk Youn has collected an impressive amount of data on those who ran for the Lower House of the Diet in the postwar period. His analysis of recruitment patterns emphasizes differences between parties and over time. Minoru Yanagihashi conducted his own survey of local and national candidates in Hyogo Prefecture to see how their perceptions of the of various electoral factors vary by party and level. His study throws new light on the role of the yuryuokusha, the ""men of influence"" often seen as dominating election campaigns. Finally, Steven Reed has looked closely at aggregate election data along with case-study evidence to assess the importance of the ""incumbency effect,"" the ""second-term barrier"" and the progressive local government movement on who comes to power in Japanese prefectures.

Japanese Automotive Industry,,Model and Challenge for the Future?,Japanese Automotive Industry: Model and Challenge for the Future?,"<p class=""Keynote"">Proceedings from the first U.S.-Japan Automotive Conference, 1981</p>","<p class=""Bkdesc"">As the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies reflected on the deteriorating position of the domestic auto industry in the fall of 1980, and the strong competitive threat being posed by the Japanese automakers, we were struck by the extraordinary low quality of the public discussion of these critical issues. The national importance of the issues seemed only matched by the superficiality of the analyses being offered. The tendency to think in terms of scapegoats was particularly evident. The Japanese as the basic cause of our problems has been a particularly notable theme. To be sure, cooperation with the Japanese in formulating a rational overall trade policy may be an important part of the solution. It has also been fashionable to blame it all on American auto industry management for not concentrating on the production of small cars when ""everyone knew"" that was the thing to do. Alternatively, government meddling was blamed for all our problems. Clearly, the complex problem we faced required more penetrating analyses. It seemed therefore, that the time was ripe for a public seminar which moved beyond the rhetoric of the moment and probed some of the deeper causes of our problems and possible directions for future policy.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">In holding the January 1981 auto conference, the Center took it as their task to begin addressing the critical issues facing the industry, with particular, but not exclusive, attention to examining the role of the Japanese auto industry. They had in mind not to simply conduct a rational discussion of the trade issue but to probe the sources of Japanese competitive strength, especially those features whose study might profit them. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">In these proceedings, they bring those discussions to a wider audience. Question and answer sessions at the conference were necessarily short and a few speakers delivered abbreviated remarks; this volume restores a number of omissions, and provides additional answers to some pertinent questions put by the audience. The Center hopes to encourage the serious problem-solving these complex issues demand. Far too much time has been spent trying to fix the blame.

The library, for a student of foreign things, is normally a sine qua non; for the work of U.S. scholars and students in Japanese studies, the collections surveyed here are a fundamental resource. Universities and centers sponsoring Japanese studies ought therefore to pay special attention to improving and maintaining them, and this publication represents part of the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies' effort toward that end.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Two surveys of note have considered academic programs on Japan at U.S. colleges and universities. The first, under the auspices of SSRC-ACLS, was published in 1970; the second, prepared for the Subcommittee of Japanese studies of the American Panel of CULCON, was published in 1977. Neither was directed particularly at the library collections supporting the programs, although both pointed to the importance of such holdings. After a workshop which it sponsored for Japanese collection librarians August 28-30 1978, in Washington D.C., the Japan-United states Friendship Commission was moved to assist an in-depth survey of the particular and general state of the research collections in this country. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">This volume contains the report of that survey, which provides librarians and others concerned with collection and service development with the kind of comparative data that is usually a spur to ambition. But the surveyors, sponsors, and others involved in the completion of this work are convinced that the future development of these valuable collections depends on cooperation in services and coordination of acquisitions among them.

Culture and Religion in Japanese-American Relations,,"Essays on Uchimura Kanzō, 1861–1930","Culture and Religion in Japanese-American Relations: Essays on Uchimura Kanzō, 1861–1930","<p class=""Keynote"">An rich collection of essays on Uchimura Kanzō--author, religious leader, Christian evangelist, and intellectual of the Meiji and Taisho eras</p>","<p class=""Bkdesc"">The appearance in the 1950s of Uchimura's collected works and studies by Masaike Jin and Suzuki Toshiro aroused considerable interest in a Christian who exemplified loyalty to both ""Christ and country."" Here was a Japanese who could advocate democracy, pacifism, and personal independence without appearing to denigrate his own past or to embrace the complete westernization of Japan or show personal subservience to Americans. The defeat and foreign occupation had posed again the painful dilemma: how to be both Japanese and modern, or in postwar terms, how to recover a healthy pride in one's national and cultural heritage while living with the radical changes imposed by American military fiat. To many, Uchimura had shown how one could be a patriot and a very ""Japanese"" person who maintained pride in his own cultural tradition while being loyal to a set of values derived from Christianity. This appealed emotionally to the Japanese who had been force-fed through education and the mass media as a massive dose of Americanism. Perhaps through Uchimura's experience they too could learn how to live with pride and confidence in a Japan being transformed by outside forces.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The authors of the following essays are representative of the current scholarship on Uchimura and his Japanese Christianity known as Mukyokai. As their footnotes indicate, several of them have recently completed substantial studies dealing with Uchimura--Ota, Ohara, Hirakawa, and Lee critical biographies, and Caldarola a sociological analysis of Mukyokai. The essays presented here give a good sense of the richness and variety of the studies and interpretations that have become available in recent years. Several of the essays raise questions about Uchimura's view of his society and his strongly ambivalent feelings about the west. While confirming his stubborn independence, they suggest that his actions were often those of one deeply alienated from both the cultures of which he was part. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">No set of relatively brief papers can hope to capture the full complexity of Uchimura and his thought. The purpose of these essays is not to offer a general interpretation but simply to suggest the rich variety that is possible. If they succeed in that modest aim, they will nonetheless have made a contribution to a better understanding of Uchimura and his role in the history of Japanese-American cultural relations.

Sukeroku's Double Identity,,The Dramatic Structure of Edo Kabuki,Sukeroku's Double Identity: The Dramatic Structure of Edo Kabuki,"<p class=""Keynote"">A study of traditional Edo kabuki through the play Sukeroku. </p>","<p class=""Bkdesc"">The aim of this book is to show that seemingly illogical double identity of the townsman, Sukeroku, and the samurai, Soga Goro, in the play Sukeroku is a surviving element of what was once a complex and coherent structure based on a traditional performance calendar.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">To show how the calendar function and what Sukeroku's double identity signifies, the book is divided into two parts. Part One studies the structure of Edo kabuki. The first chapter, which outlines that structure, is based for the most part on writings of the Tokugawa period. The second chapter then looks at the concepts of sekai, ""tradition,"" and shuko, ""innovation."" Kabuki was the product of material that had become a familiar part of Japanese culture by repeated use and dramatization over long periods of time, starting before kabuki began, and material that was relatively new and was used to transform the older, set material. The double identity in Sukeroku came about as a result of this interplay between what was received by way of traditional and what was added by way of innovation.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Part Two considers the significance of the double identity. The author concludes that Sukeroku's double identity gave Edo audiences a hero who was an idealization of the contemporary Tokugawa townsman and at the same time a transformation of a samurai god-hero of the past. The first chapter of Part Two traces the development of Sukeroku's Soga Goro/samurai identity, from its origins in the early dramatic forms of no, kowaka, and ko-joruri, to the representation of Soga Goro in kabuki by Ichikawa Danjuro I. The seconds then looks at the transformation of Soga Gorointo Sukeroku by discussing the origins of Sukeroku and its introductions to Edo kabuki by Ichikawa Danjuro I and his son, Danjuro II, since their work was the basis of all later developments. </p> <p class=""Toreview"">[Insert author bio]</p>",112,6,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Papers in Japanese Studies

One left the conference with a sense that there was a call for action, a mandate to address the problems facing industry.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The mood, about a year later, at the March 1982 U.S.-Japan Auto Conference was far more subdued. While undoubtedly this reflected the stream of statistics confirming the continually depressed state of the industry, another dynamic was possibly operating as well. Whereas the 1981 conference was ""electric,"" a state of mind which flowed from a certain frustration at seemingly overwhelming difficulties and often vague expectations of what we might learn from the Japanese, the 1982 conference was more ""workmanlike"" in the sense that speakers discussed specifically what progress was being made in addressing problems. This more subdued, pragmatic approach continued throughout wand was reinforced by workshops held the day after the main conference. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Instead of discussing the virtues of the Just-In-Time system in Japan, speakers addressed the practical problems of introducing such a system in the U.S. firms. Instead of railing about the benefits or failings of regulation of the industry, they discussed what we could reasonably expect from regulation. Instead of exhorting the industry to adopt Japanese practices willy-nilly, they focused on some of the limitations of the Japanese model in a range of different areas. Instead of trying to identify some magic key to Japanese success in the automotive industry, they discussed the interrelationships among various factors. At the same, they continued to explore the basic issues transforming the auto industry worldwide. In this connection, they sought to unravel some of the complexities associated with the internalization of the auto industry and trade obligations under the GATT. </p> <p class=""Toreview"">[Insert author bio]</p>",120,7,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Papers in Japanese Studies

Untouched by the trends in Tokyo, he could from a fresh angle catch and fix in words the shifts of wind and cloud, the habits of small animals, the afternoon feeling of a small station where no one boards or descends from the train, passing encounters with people of the village, a field of withered grass, Japanese vegetables solid on a table, the shape of cakes made form wild fruit.

For, although many scholars of various disciplines are interested in the New Religions, few of them are able to read the Japanese materials on the subject.

The data presented and analyzed here consist of records from participant observation, formal and informal interviews, casual conversation and formal questionnaires, and public and private documents.

A hamlet is fundamentally a nexus for the organization of productive exchange among member households, the form of exchange through which two or more parties actively combine their resources to produce something of value not available, or as cheaply available, to any of them separately. Defection from productive exchange agreements by hamlet members is reduced by making access to future valuable transactions and corporate property contingent upon the integrity of each current exchange transaction. This method of combining a common interest in production with contingent access to productive resources is termed mutual investment and is the major source of consensus in hamlet decision making. When only cooperate resources are at issue, decisions regularly result in unanimity. When a course of action can be implemented only if hamlet members relinquish control over individually held resources, a division will emerge among the membership. Whether or not a formal vote is taken, the distribution of differing opinion will be known through more informal means of communication. In all cases of division, by the time the course of action to be implemented is formally announced, the minority in opposition will be extremely small. The question then must be resolved whether those in the minority will participate in the implementation or resign as hamlet members. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc""><span lang=""EN"" style=""background:white;mso-highlight:white"">This book is written with two rather disparate audiences in mind: readers interested primarily in exchange and decision-making phenomenon, on the one hand, and readers interested primarily in the unity of experience represented by the Japanese sensibility, on the other. </p>",192,11,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Papers in Japanese Studies

He is less well known than other writers (Yasuoka Shotaro, Kojima Nobuo, and Shono Junzo) with whom he has associated and whose works have been liberally translated into English.

There are no stories here, for instance, about childhood or student life, and none of his many travel stories. Some of his most famous stories-- ""When we Never Left Port,"" for example--have not been included. But the stories presented here do offer a considerable variety of style, from the pristine storybook language of ""The Farthest Edge of the Islands,"" to the young intellectual's jargon of ""Everyday Life in a Dream,"" to the visionary, hysterical, occasionally ritualistic prose of the ""sick wife"" stories, to the sober, difficult, almost ponderous narration of ""This Time That Summer."" Shimao's approach to his material varies as well. ""Everyday Life in a Dream"" is the only representative here of a large number of stories usually called surrealistic by the critics, stories whose plots progress by the logic of dreams. The individual experience of real life are lived through a combination of conscious and unconscious perception. These stories are the least approachable and the least charming to the casual reader, but they serve, among other things, to highlight patterns in the more realistic fiction. ""The Farthest Edge of the Islands"" is a symbolic heightening of reality in another way, a romantic fairy tale beginning at the extremity of experience, at the farthest edge of the world. The other stories are presented as precise, close chronicles of reality by a participant in that reality whose attention never waivers and who never allows himself to avert his eyes from a world that he sees as his responsibility and in a sense his fault. All but the first story, ""The Farthest Edge of the Islands,"" which is in third-person narration, are told in the first person by the character who plays Shimao's role in the life that inspired the fiction. </p> <p class=""Toreview"">[Insert author bio]</p>",200,12,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Papers in Japanese Studies

In the subsequent two conferences in 1982 and 1983, the concerned parties displayed an impressive willingness to roll up their sleeves and get on with creating the conditions for a renewal of the industry.

In addition, those who know the industry well knew that the major improvements in quality and productivity had been made, and many of the changes responsible for these improvements seem unlikely to be reversed. All this was much on the minds of speakers and participants during the March conference. The various speakers presented an image of people who thought that they were pretty much on the way toward addressing successfully their internal problems of productivity, quality, and marketing.

Arguably the most important impact of the Japanese challenge to Detroit was a sudden loss of complacency, a realization that the old ways would no longer be enough. A ""mature"" industry was suddenly thrust back into adolescence. The response was a surge of entrepreneurial behavior, not just the individual flamboyance of a Lee Iacocca, but a host of innovations in product, manufacturing, internal organization, and relationships between OEMs and suppliers.

Consider, for example, just three of the changes that took place in the United States. First, Ford Motor Company returned a greater profit than General Motors for the first time in sixty years. Second, American Motors, the last of the small, independent automakers, was absorbed by Chrysler. And finally, Honda announced American capacity plans that may conceivably enable it to vault unto Big Three status by the 1990s.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Nor is the pace of change likely to diminish much in the future. On the contrary, it is generally conceded that the global automotive industry is afflicted with enough overcapacity that the next economic downturn will inevitably lead to dislocations extending far beyond the industry itself.

Because the problems dealt with are complex ones involving many levels and kinds of patronage, the essays perhaps pose more questions than they answer, but at the very least they serve the purpose of opening up a new arena of research that is essential to a full understanding of the arts in the late medieval age. In this respect they may best be understood as case studies, presented in the anticipation of further work in a long-overlooked area of cultural history.

Its anonymous author followed the venerable ""poem-tale"" tradition by using 128 of Saigyo's finest and best-known poems and weaving around them facts and legends about the poet. The result is a biographical ""journey"" through his life. Saigyo moves from the life of a brilliant and favored young poet at the Heian imperial court, through a Buddhist ""awakening"" that leads him to cast off his worldly life and family ties and to transform himself into a wandering monk in search of salvation, through the vicissitudes of his long hard life on the road, to a final apotheosis as Buddhist saint in his famous death. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">While <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">The Tale of Saigyo</i> is on one level the story of the making of a Buddhist saint, it is also a biography of the trials and sorrows of an idealized poetic sensibility during a tempestuous time that saw the death of the Heian period, the Genpei Wars, and the beginning of the turbulent Kamakura period. The moving portrait of the wandering poet-monk that emerges through this tale crystallized the image of Saigyo and is felt in such later literary figures as Basho, who acknowledged Saigyo as his model and master. </p>",104,25,UM Center for Japanese Studies,Michigan Papers in Japanese Studies

Masked Ritual and Performance in South India,,,Masked Ritual and Performance in South India,,"<p class=""Toreview"">[Insert keynote]</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Masked and Ritual and Performance in South India is the first scholarly volume to address descriptively, analytically and comparatively the many traditions of masked performance in southern India. South Indian masks are among the most colorful and visually compelling in the world, but they have never been studied as a set of related ritual and performance phenomena. After several introductory essays on the phenomenon of masking in general, including the outline of a new analytic model for mask performance by D. Shulman, individual chapters of the volume address particular traditions such as Hiranya Natakam and Kataikkuttu (Tamil Nadu), Teyyam, Krsnattam, and Mutiyettu (Kerala), and Sinhala exorcism rituals. Essays by Edwin Gerow and Wendy Doniger draw connections with classical Sanskrit materials on masking and disguise. Each of the chapters blends empirical data and theoretical insights; an integrative Postlude by Don Handelman proposes a highly original typology of ritual forms that braid together frames and contents, as in many of the traditions studied here.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Throughout South India, masks are related to the presence of divine beings and, as such, induce transformation in the awareness of both performers and audience. Masked performance may also be powerfully linked to rituals of healing, which aim at freeing the self from states of blockage, isolation, and possession. Taken together, the essays offer an initial grammar of South Indian masking as the culture-specific formation of visible surfaces in which primary issues of identity, self-knowledge, and perception are brought into play. Masking thus implies meta-psychological perspectives on the notions of self, face, and maturation and on the internal economy of the mind in cultures far removed from standard Western psychological paradigms.</p>",288,,UM Center for South Asian Studies,

The book challenges the notion of the court and the monastic order as static institutions by examining how competition within and between them prompted major rethinking about the intellectual foundations of indigenous society and culture. The catalyst for this reformation of indigenous thought was the rise of a small clique of Buddhist monks and lay people from the frontier to commanding positions in the state and monastic order over the course of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This clique had a major influence on the creation of state myths, the ways in which the throne ruled and presented itself, and, ultimately, the relationship between the throne and the state. The new state and monastic orthodoxy, however, was challenged by other Burmese literati, who, over the course of the nineteenth century, sought in Western science, technology, and political theory other ways in which to shape Burmese perspectives on state and society. In the process, the Burmese underwent a difficult transition from premodern to modern intellectual thought, one that helped usher in British rule.</p>",312,,UM Center for South East Asian Studies,
Ram Khamaeng Controversy,The,Collected Papers,The Ram Khamaeng Controversy: Collected Papers,,"<p class=""Bkdesc"">The history of Thailand as a nation relies principally upon evidence from its first capital at Sukhothai. There, in the late thirteenth century, King Ram Khamhaeng devised the writing system handed down to posterity on the stone now known as Inscription No. 1. The stone was discovered by King Mongkut (Rama IV) in Sukhothai in 1833, before his ascent to the throne. </p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">In recent years serious doubt has been cast upon the authenticity of Inscription No. 1, and some authorities have branded it outright as fake. One distinguished art historian has even presented evidence that the inscription is the work of King Mongkut himself. If this premise is correct, much of the history of Thailand will be open to reinterpretation. Perhaps for that reason, and because Ram Khamhaeng is seen as a father figure in the nation he welded into the first Thai kingdom, the claim that the inscription is not genuine has been hotly disputed by more conservative voices. The arguments and counterarguments put forward by experts from various disciplines at conferences and seminars, and in papers and articles, have been skillfully assembled in this illustrated volume.

The product of this effort, as it is encompassed in this volume, is not an attempt at the definitive study of any of the topics. It is rather a series of speculations on the directions feasible for the further study of the Southeast Asian past. As such, the answers proposed in these essays are really questions. Are the ideas presented here true within the specific historical contexts for which they have been developed? If so, can we use these ideas, or variations of them, to interpret the history of other parts of Southeast Asia?

Yet, as is illustrated in this monograph, the most important learning regarding fertility behavior may be unrelated to any school activity and an understanding of the nature of this learning can be useful to program planners.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The present research approaches the problem from the standpoint of the socialization of youth. Socialization is not only the preparation of youth to perform traditional roles but also the teaching of new roles which are necessary as a result of changes affecting the society. It is the consistency with which roles are performed from one generation to the next that maintains established social structure and much has been made of the need to change the structure of peasant societies if fertility is to be changed.

Recently, however, they have acknowledged that ecosystems cannot be understood without taking into account human interventions that may have taken place for thousands of years. And for their part, social scientists have recognized that human behavior must be understood in the environment in which it is acted out. Researchers have thus begun to develop the area of ""human ecology."" Yet human ecology needs suitable conceptual frameworks to tie the human and natural together.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">In response, <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Cultural Values and Human Ecology</i> uses the framework of cultural values to collect a set of highly diverse contributions to the field of human ecology. Values represent an important and essential aspect of the intellectual organization of a society, integrated into and ordained by the over-arching cosmological system, and constituting the meaningful basis for action, in terms of concreteness and abstraction of content as well as mutability and permanence. Because of this balance, values lend themselves to the kinds of analyses of ecological relationships conducted here, those that demand a reasonable amount of specificity as well as historical stability.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The contributions to <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">Cultural Values and Human Ecology </i>are exceedingly diverse. They include abstract theoretical discussions and specific case studies, ranging across the landscape of Southeast Asia from the islands to southern China. They deal with hunting-gathering populations as well as peasants operating within contemporary nation-states, and they are the work of natural scientists, social scientists, and humanists of Western and Asian origin.

It aims at teaching Sanskrit as a language, rather than as a religious or mystical entity. It also simplifies the process of learning Sanskrit by dissociating this language-learning process from the heavy burdens imposed both by the tradition of Indo-European linguistics and the tradition of indigenous Sanskrit grammarians in India. By treating Sanskrit as a productive language, rather than as a dead language merely to be deciphered, the book represents a significant advance over the traditional Western approach to the study of Sanskrit.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">Work on this book began in 1976, and now almost two generations of Professor Deshpande's students have used successively improved versions. The book's examples include many modified versions of classical Sanskrit passages from epic texts such as The Mahabharata and The Ramayana. The book also contains examples from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions, as well as samples of Sanskrit poetry and satire.""</p>",504,47,UM Center for South Asian Studies,Michigan Papers on South and Southeast Asia
Journey,The,Stories by K. C. Das,The Journey: Stories by K. C. Das,"<p class=""Keynote"">This exceptional collection of stories explores human emotions and motivations in all their untidiness.</p>","<p class=""Bkdesc"">K. C. Das is deservedly one of the most celebrated writers in India today. He writes primarily in Oriya, the language of his native state of Orissa, where he was born in 1924. A civil servant by profession, Das pursued a second career as a writer of stories, poems, and essays.</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">The stories in this collection take place in an urban setting. The characters are mainly middle class, making them more accessible to North American readers than other examples of contemporary Indian fiction. These are not simple stories. They are about ""divides,"" about gaps between realities and imagination. In complex shifts between direct dialogue, interior monologue, and interior or imagined dialogue, Das lovingly but mercilessly exposes his characters' thoughts, self-deceptions, and the games they play with each other. These are stories about human weaknesses, the fallibility of human relationships, and the strategies we adopt to cope with our failures. They are about coming to terms with unpleasant, sometimes shocking truths about ourselves and others.</p>",156,48,UM Center for South Asian Studies,Michigan Papers on South and Southeast Asia

Such a scenario raises several questoins. What factors have caused and maintain deforestation and the resulting environmental patchiness of characteristic of the area? How long has this been occurring and to what extent have the different causes varied in their degree and impact through time? Is it possible to make any statements as to the stability of the present environment?</p> <p class=""Bkdesc"">These questions derive from, and reflect, an attempt to more parsimoniously view the ways in which human actors participate in the formation and maintenance of dynamic ecosystems by more explicitly incorporating the generative potential of succession theory into analysis of human adaptation. A fundamental point which I wish to make in this study is that the history of an ecosystem is more than a series of events which can only be described in the particular.
