            "Book Description": "China's most outrageous character\u2014the magical Monkey who battles a hundred monsters\u2014returns to the fray in this seventeenth-century sequel to the Buddhist novel Journey to the West. In The Tower of Myriad Mirrors, he defends his claim to enlightenment against a villain who induces hallucinations that take Monkey into the past, to heaven and hell, and even through a sex change. The villain turns out to be the personification of his own desires, aroused by his penetration of a female adversary's body in Journey to the West.\nIn this, his only novel, author Tung Yueh (1620-1686), a monk and Confucian scholar, picks up the slapstick of the original tale and overlays it with Buddhist theory and bitter satire of the Ming government's capitulation to the Manchus. After a nod to Journey's storyteller format, Tung carries Monkey's quest into an evocation of shifting psychological states rarely found in premodern fiction. An important though relatively unknown link in the development of the Chinese novel and window into late Ming intellectual history, The Tower of Myriad Mirrors further rewards by being a wonderful read.",

            "Book Description": "In this series of lectures on the painters Hsia Kuei (twelfth-thirteenth centuries), Shen Chou (fifteenth-sixteenth centuries), and Shih-t'ao (seventeenth-eighteenth centuries), Richard Edwards explores the special relationship between the self and landscape in Chinese art. These three painters, each important in his own time and deemed a master by later critics, were all concerned with the subjective in the objective world. In Chinese painting there is no clear desire to separate these two realms; rather, there is a constant, conscious play between the physical reality of the world and the subjective vision of the artist. The artist is continually imitating the world--sometimes more, sometimes less--but he never denies its appearance to the point of total abstraction; nor, in the other extreme, does he claim for the physical world an existence independent of his own involvement.",

Many of these contrast dramatically with long-held Western beliefs, key among them the insistence on the commingling of rational thought, the emotions, and motives.

            "Book Description": "An international relations classic, The Chinese Calculus of Deterrence presents a framework for anticipating Chinese political-military behavior in the nuclear era. Through analysis and scholarly research, Allen S. Whiting reconstructs China's response to the perceived threat from India in 1962 and Beijing's secret military participation in the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1968. Comparing these with Chinese actions in the Korean War and Sino-Soviet border clashes, Whiting reveals the patterns in Chinese calculations of deterrence and the use of force. \nThis book throws light on policy divisions at the highest levels in Beijing and on Chinese miscalculations in coping with enemy states. It also suggests ways in which other states can affect Chinese perceptions and behavior to reduce the likelihood of conflict. The analysis presented here strips away the mystery surrounding Chinese behavior and reveals it to be not so far removed from that of other governments. This volume includes a new foreword that considers recent data and developments in the Taiwan Strait. ",

Nancy Lee Swann presents a sketch of the Eastern Han period when Pan lived and wrote, of her family background, and of the literary milieu of which she was a part. In addition, Swann provides translations of writings definitively identified with Pan that survive from the years when she was active (ca. 89--105 a.d.).\nWhile Pan is well known for her contribution to the great Han-shu, of special interest is her treatise on the moral training of women, in which she makes a plea for girls to be given the same education as boys and points to principles that led young women to success in ancient China. Swann also includes memorials, short poems, and an essay, all of which demonstrate Pan's rhetorical skills and her concerns at the Han court.\nA considerable work of scholarship, Pan Chao is grounded in Swann's detailed knowledge of the history and literature of the late Han and it includes the Chinese for shorter works and a comprehensive list of primary sources on this important early scholar.",

            "Book Description": "Hailed at its first release as \"exceptional among studies of Chinese philosophy,\" a work \"combining philosophical acumen with sinological competence that raises the study of early Chinese thought to a new level of sophistication,\" The Concept of Man in Early China remains a staple in the study of early Chinese civilization. Addressing the very roots of Chinese culture and thought, this path-breaking work frequently compares conceptsfrom the Confucian and Taoist traditions with those from Western classical philosophy. Donald J. Munro clearly identifies key ideas about human nature and links these ideas within the intellectual universe of classical China. ",

With its focus on the down-to-earth, colloquial, high-frequency vocabulary and discourse patterns of authentic spoken Chinese, Ling\u2019s book addresses a need neglected by most traditional textbooks. Although the guide has been prepared for students who have completed two years of Chinese, it is flexible enough to accommodate a broad range of language levels. Its user-friendly features include indexes, summary vocabulary lists, vocabulary items ranked into three levels of priority, bottom-of-page vocabulary annotations, English explanations of grammar points with sample sentences, and complex and simplified characters on facing pages. An excellent film on its own merits, Under the Bridge tells the story of a lost generation struggling with unemployment, crime, and psychological scars as they try to rebuild their lives amid the rubble of the Cultural Revolution.",

Then, translating poems ranging from the Rabelaisian to the sublime, Crump explores its favorite themes: human absurdity, the poignant and comic aspects of love and desire, the futility of ambition, and the joys of rustic life. Interweaving lively translations of one hundred and twenty poems with discussion of their social and literary context, Song-Poems from Xanadu is a succinct introduction to the special pleasures of these lyrics from the age of Kublai Khan. Includes the complete character text of all poems.",

The separate introductions to the two genres introduce the student to the history and uses of these materials. In addition to providing bibliographic data and noting variant editions, each entry provides locations where a work or its later editions can be found, whether in North America, Europe, China, or Japan.Timothy Brook is Professor of Chinese History, University of Toronto.

Applying new critical methods to medieval works in the genre know as Music Bureau poetry (yuefu shi), Joseph R. Allen strips away layers of ossified conventional reading to expose the genre\u2019s vital core. Arguing that Music Bureau poetry is best understood in terms of the imitative poetics now known as intratextuality, Allen explores the evolution of yuefu poetry and issues central to all genre formation. In the Voice of Others culminates in an in-depth consideration of the acknowledged master of Music Bureau poetry, the Tang poet Li Bo (Li Po).",

            "Book Description": " The relationships, both historical and philosophical, among the Zhuangzi's Inner, Outer, and Miscellaneous chapters are the subject of ancient and enduring controversy. Liu marshals linguistic, intertextual, intratextual, and historical evidence to establish an objectively demonstrable chronology and determine the philosophical affiliations among the various chapters. This major advance in Zhuangzi scholarship furnishes indispensable data for all students of the great Daoist text. In a lengthy afterword, Liu compares his conclusions with those of A. C. Graham and addresses the relationship between the Zhuangzi and the Laozi. Liu Xiaogan is Professor of Philosophy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ",

Professor Munro draws on philosophical, social science, and popular culture materials to explore the legacy of the \u201cimperial style of inquiry\u201d in modern China. This style of inquiry is associated with the belief that the universe is a coherent, internally structured unity understandable through the similarly structured human mind. It involves a reliance on antecedent and authoritarian models, coupled with an introspective focus in investigations, at some cost to objective fact gathering. He contrasts this style of inquiry with emergent forms that are guided by the values of individual autonomy and new perspectives on objectivity.",

The development of the major literary genres is traced in each of these periods. The reference section in the cloth edition includes an annotated bibliography of more than 120 pages; the paper edition has a shorter bibliography and is intended for classroom use. ",

The Matrix of lyric Transformation enriches this tradition, using modern analytical methods to explore issues of self-expression and to trace the early formal, thematic, and generic developments of this poetic form. Beginning with a discussion of the Yueh-fu and ku-shih genres of the Han period, Cai argues that changing practices of poetic composition effected a shift from a dramatic mode typical of folk compositions to a narrative mode and finally to lyric and symbolic modes developed in literati circles.

Adapting the perspectives of ventriloquism and dialogism from Bakhtin and Holquist, Yang proposes a model of development into which he places Feng's works and uses this model to explain Feng's approach to selecting and working with his source materials.\nYang locates Feng Menglong's Sanyan in the broader cultural milieu of the late Ming and discusses the then-dominant archaist movement in literature, literati marginality and anxieties, the subversive use of folk works, and the meiren xiangcao tradition--appropriating a female identity to express male frustration. Against this background he persuasively pieces together a rationale for Feng\u2019s elevating and promoting the vernacular story while stepping back form an overt authorial role.\n",

            "Book Description": "In this first study of how politics was actually conducted in warlord-era Peking, Professor Nathan analyzes both the sources of the constitutionalist faith and the destructive effects of factionalism. He presents an analysis of factionalism in a model that explains the typical behavioral patterns of factional political conflict in terms of the organizational structures of factions. This model will interest scholars in disciplines concerned with conflict and is relevant to any cultural setting. \nThe political realities of the early Republican era in China emerge from Nathan\u2019s case studies with clarity and concreteness. The failure of constitutionalism in China was important not only because it invited more radical alternatives, but also because the manner of its failure alerted later leaders to the kind of chaos they must try to avoid.

            "Book Description": "Lord Lao, first known as the philosopher Laozi, the purported author of the Daode jing, later became an immortal, a messiah, and high god of Daoism. Laozi, divinized during the Han dynasty and in early Daoist movements, reached his highest level of veneration under the Tang when the rulers honored him as a royal ancestor. In subsequent eras he remained prominent and is still a major deity in China today.\nLivia Kohn's two-part study first traces the historical development of Lord Lao and the roles he played at different times for different believers. Part Two is based on one of Lord Lao's major hagiographies, the twelfth-century Youlong zhuan (Like Unto a Dragon), and studies the complex myth surrounding him. Lord Lao appears in eight distinct mythical roles, each associated with a particular phase in his life: He is the creator of the universe, bringer of cosmic order, teacher of dynasties, and the divine made flesh on earth. He is also the converter of the barbarians, the source of major Daoist revelations, and the god of Great Peace and political harmony. Comparing his story with related Confucian, Buddhist, and Western mythic tropes, Kohn illuminates the dynamics of the Daoist tale and persuades us to appreciate Lord Lao as a key deity of traditional China. Includes illustrations and tables.",

Following a background sketch of the earlier Han dynasty Chang'an and an analysis of the canonical and geomantic bases of the layout of the Sui-Tang capital, this volume focuses on the essential components of the city--its palaces, central and local administrative quarters, ritual centers, marketplaces, residential wards, and monasteries. Based on careful textual and archaeological research, this volume gives a sense of why Sui-Tang Chang'an was considered the most spectacular metropolis of its age.\nVictor C.

            "Book Description": "The local self-government movement in China began in the late Qing, and by the Revolution of 1911 no less than five thousand self-government councils had formed around the country. While the idea of a federated state was cherished by early revolutionaries, a growing conflict between federalist and centralist leaders culminated in the defeat of federalism in the mid-1920s. The story of this movement has since remained hidden behind Nationalist and Communist accounts of the early revolutionary struggle.\nThis study of Chen Jiongming's political career reopens the record on federalist efforts, focusing on Chen's policies and administrative achievements in Fujian and Guangdong. It describes Chen's role in the tumultuous politics of southern China from 1909 until his death in 1933, including his relationship and notorious break with Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the centralist revolutionaries. Leslie Chen argues that his father's attempts to create a democratic, federalist system in Guangdong were aimed at providing a model for China as a whole. His account is lively and readable; it gives an intimate, yet historically accurate, account of Chen Jiongming's considerable role in early twentieth-century Chinese history.",

            "Book Description": "Between the 1890s and the Second World War, twenty-five million people traveled from the densely populated North China provinces of Shandong and Hebei to seek employment in the growing economy of China's three northeastern provinces, the area known as Manchuria. This was the greatest population movement in modern Chinese history and ranks among the largest migrations in the world. This book is the first comprehensive study of that migration. Drawing on the disciplines of the coauthors, the book focuses on both the broad quantitative outlines of the movement and on the decisions and experiences of individual migrants and their families. The book lays out the historical relationship between North China and the Northeast (Manchuria) and concludes with an examination of ongoing population movement between these regions since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.",

            "Book Description": "This book explores responses to Tang Xianzu's classic play The Peony Pavilion (Mudan ting) from three distinct segments of its public-literati playwrights; professional performers of Kun opera; and quite recently, directors and audiences outside China. Catherine Swatek first examines two adaptations of the play by Tang's contemporaries, which point to the unconventionality of the original work. She goes on to explore how the play has been changed in later adaptations, up to its most recent productions by Peter Sellars and Chen Shi-Zheng in the United States and Europe. Peony Pavilion Onstage teases significant social and cultural information from textual sources. It is one of the few full-length studies in English of Chinese drama and the only one to focus on this pivotal work.",

He clarifies how Guomindang factions and to a lesser extent the Chinese Communist Party competed in local-level social movements and political struggles in Jiangsu. While most studies of modern Chinese state-making focus on government institutions, the author reminds us that the party organization must also be considered an important player in this process.",

            "Book Description": "Delving into the archives of the Zongli Yamen\u2014the Qing dynasty bureau that mediated conflicts between foreign missionaries, local Christians, and local communities\u2014Alan Sweeten presents detailed accounts of interactions between Catholics and non-Catholics in the market towns and villages of Jiangxi. Sweeten pieces together a close view of tensions in the countryside, their eruption into violence, and as often, their peaceful resolution. He concludes that the sources of tension lay with day-to-day problems common throughout rural China, rather than with issues of religion per se. Although religious identity did play a role in local conflict during this forty-year period, personal or family disputes, poverty, and general alienation turn out to be equally important factors.\nEarlier scholarship on urban anti-Christian incidents pointed to agitation by local elites against aggressive missionaries and the enclaving of Chinese Christians apart from their communities, yet this author's findings suggest that Catholics in rural Jiangxi were normally well integrated into their larger communities, and conflict with Catholics was more often a contest of personal interests among neighbors.",

The result has been that the few have influenced the many, perpetuating a cycle of production of films from China that bow to the Western notion of \"Chineseness.\" As a corrective, the author introduces readers to a much larger canon of film and proposes a multidirectional model of film studies, one that allows for a Western reading of Chinese film yet also recognizes Chinese cinema's own voice.",

For Xiao, The Stone is a lament for the end of literati culture and an allegory for the transition of literati writing from the lyric to the prose tradition. It figures the decline of poetry and the \"lyrical\" lives of China's elite and the rise of both the novel and new social and cultural forms fueled by mercantilism. By focusing on the role of the garden in The Stone, Xiao Chi reveals the special linkages between the world of fiction, the world that produced the novel, and the narrative universe of the story itself.",

            "Book Description": "Traditional woodblock prints preserve a Chinese folk art that has now nearly vanished. This book explores and explains the artistic and aesthetic bases of popular prints revealed in eighty-four late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century prints belonging to the London-based Muban Foundation.\nWoodblock printing was the principal method of producing inexpensive and colorful single-sheet images for mass consumption in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century China. Prints of this type are known today as \"New Year pictures\" because the demand for them peaked at New Year's time. However, the term \"popular print\" more accurately describes these works, whose subjects include deities and tutelary spirits, illustrations to stories and operas, and even contemporary political or revolutionary messages.\nThe emphasis on the artistic aspects of these prints makes this publication uniquely appealing to Chinese art historians but also to those interested in Chinese anthropology, popular religion, Chinese and other folk art, and traditional crafts.\nEllen J. Laing received a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. She was Maude I. Kerns Distinguished Professor of Oriental Art, University of Oregon and is currently Research Associate at the Center for Chinese Studies, University of Michigan. She has published numerous scholarly articles, books, and reference works on Chinese art.",

            "Book Description": "This volume counters the widely accepted notion that traditional family patterns are weakened by forces such as economic development and social revolutions. China has experienced wrenching changes on both the economic and the political fronts, yet from the evidence presented here the tradition of filial respect and support for aging parents remains alive and well.\nUsing collaborative surveys carried out in 1994 in the middle-sized industrial city of Baoding and comparative data from urban Taiwan, the authors examine issues shaping the relationships between adult Chinese children and their elderly parents. The continued vitality of intergenerational support and filial obligations in these samples is not simply an instance of strong Confucian tradition trumping powerful forces of change. Instead, and somewhat paradoxically, the continued strength of filial obligations can be attributed largely to the institutions of Chinese socialism forged in the era of Mao Zedong. With socialist institutions now under assault in the People's Republic of China, the future of intergenerational relations in the twenty-first century is once again uncertain.",

            "Book Description": "Over the course of the twentieth century, the Guomindang (the KMT or Nationalists) articulated and marketed symbols, traits, and institutions crucial to a modernizing China. Understood as constituents of modernity, tangible elements (paper money, flags, national anthems), specific institutions (educational, governmental, and scientific facilities), and intangible qualities (nationalism, social trust, social discipline) all drew the attention and advocacy of Party members. \nThis volume offers a reappraisal of Guomindang history based on a close analysis of cultural, ideational, and symbolic practices rather than the more common social, political, and economic frames. Chapters on education policies and practices, Party relations with Chinese Christian and missionary communities, the use of paper currency, political propaganda, and the construction of scientific institutions all provide fresh points of comparison with Chinese Communist ideas, practices, and dilemmas. The essays here highlight the complexities and range of creative possibilities confronting a nation-state bent upon the \"modernizing\" mission. ",

            "Book Description": "While twentieth-century Shanghai has received extensive scholarly treatment, the nineteenth century has remained understudied, even though it encompasses the first half-century of Shanghai's growth as a treaty port and the early years of Chinese-foreign contact. Published in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the Dianshizhai Pictorial provides a record of the new urban popular culture that emerged in Shanghai's foreign settlements during this period. \nYe Xiaoqing has based this study on the Dianshizhai's detailed illustrations of everyday life at home, in commercial establishments, and in Shanghai's public areas. Her introduction to the more than one hundred drawings presented here points to the social background, lifestyle, and intellectual outlook of the Dianshizhai's literati writers and artists, the weakness of gentry control in the foreign settlements, and the commercialization and \"modern\" material culture that made Shanghai distinctive. The drawings and commentaries of the Dianshizhai contrast the settlements with \"traditional\" culture and urban life in the adjacent Chinese city and vividly convey items of interest--from the quotidian to the bizarre--highlighting local fascination with and anxiety at the rapid changes in Shanghai's increasingly cosmopolitan society.

            "Book Description": "From its inception in the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.), the salt monopoly was a key component in the Chinese government's financial toolkit. Salt, with its highly localized and large-scale production, was an ideal target for bureaucratic management.\nIn the Song dynasty (960-1279), fiscal pressures on the government had intensified with increased centralization and bureaucratization. A bloated administration and an enormous standing army maintained against incursions by aggressive steppe neighbors placed tremendous strain on Song finances. Developing the salt monopoly seemed a logical and indeed urgent strategy, but each actor in this plan---the emperor, local officials, monopoly administrators, producers, merchants, and consumers---had his own interests to protect and advance. Thus attempts to maximize the effectiveness of the monopoly meant frequent policy swings and led to levels of corruption that would ultimately undo the Song.\nUnlike other contemporary sources, the Songshi treatise organizes its subject into an intelligible and detailed narrative, elucidating special terminology, the bureaucracy and its processes, and debates relating to Chinese finance and politics, as well as the salt industry itself. Professor Chien's extensive annotation relies on parallel histories that corroborate and supplement the Songshi account, together providing a comprehensive study of this important institution in China's premodern political economy.\nCecilia Chien is Assistant Professor in the Division of Humanities at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.",

In this study, Professor Enatsu argues that at the end of the Qing, as this region was placed under civil administration, many Han bannermen in the newly created Fengtian Province came to local prominence, first as landlords, then as power elites\u2014active participants in provincial politics\u2014through the reforms of the late Qing and the early Republic. Key local leaders such as Yuan Jinkai, Zhang Rong, Zhang Huangxiang, Wu Jingliang, and Wang Yuquan may be traced to the roles of the Han Banners.\nDrawing on classic Japanese and Chinese resources on the area and recent scholarship, Professor Enatsu presents a fine analysis of the interplay between historical Qing institutions and emerging modern political practices during this tumultuous period.",

            "Book Description": "This video-and-text teaching program focuses on building the practical spoken skills of beginning students. The video, produced by the Language Resource Center at the University of Michigan, features thirty skits that cover a wide range of daily activities such as introducing yourself, inviting a friend to the movies, asking for directions, talking about your family, and shopping. The skits provide a model for students to learn and then improvise on. Each segment introduces new vocabulary and reviews grammatical structures. Excellent for improving pronunciation, tones, and listening comprehension, as well as providing an opportunity for beginning students to learn Chinese body language and gestures. The accompanying textbook includes the dialogues in English and pinyin along with character text in both simplified and traditional characters, vocabulary lists with sample sentences to clarify proper use of key expressions, and discussion questions.\nThis video for this product is non-returnable unless damaged. Damaged copies should be returned to the University of Michigan's Language Resource Center. Instructions on how to do so are included with video. For more information, contact Terre Fisher at the Center for Chinese Studies.",

In place of the episodic tale of fantastic adventures so popular with nineteenth-century Japanese readers, Futabatei presented a story with the simplest plot. The whole novel hinges on the fact that the hero, Utsumi Bunzo, has lost his post in the lowest ranks of the government bureaucracy. As a consequence, he finds that his marriage to his cousin. Osei, which had been virtually assured, has now become impossible. Osei\u2019s affections soon turn to Bunzo\u2019s former college, the up-and-coming Honda Noboru. Futabatei tells his entire story within the confines of this plot. There are only four main characters\u2014Bunzo, Noboru, Osei, and Osei\u2019s mother, Omasa\u2014and a few minor characters. It was Futabatei\u2019s intention to picture the nature of his society through these characters; to demonstrate by means of the words and actions of his characters the effect of Meiji life on Japanese society.",

            "Book Description": "From the Introduction:\nSoseki was a sick man when he wrote Grass on the Wayside. After 1910, when he very nearly died from stomach ulcers, he seems to have felt that death was not far away. He wrote the novel in 1915, when he was forty-eight; the following year, before he could complete Light and Darkness (Meian), he died. \nThe period dealt with in Grass on the Wayside is very short. It begins soon after the author\u2019s return from London in 1903 and ends as his career as a writer is about to begin. (I am a Cat was published in 1905). Kenzo (the name Soseki gives himself) is at this time in his middle thirties, and his wife in her middle twenties. It was then, presumably, that relations between Soseki and his wife became strained and he began to be acutely conscious of his loneliness. \nThe novel has its shortcomings. It is not devoid of self-pity or na\u00efvet\u00e9, and it is so introspective that the reader may find it at times rather slow-moving. Nevertheless, it is all in his most serious work. And of the countless number of autobiographical novels that have been written in Japan since the early 1900\u2019s, it is perhaps the most distinguished.\n",

Nagai Kafu may be considered such an author. Therefore, this book is an introduction to the man and his city, accompanied by a fairly generous sampling from his works.

            "Book Description": "From intoduciton/preface: The Nihon koten bungaku taikei text, based on the Tomatsubon, is the one translated here. The Tomatsubon is the odlest known complete Okagami version, probably copied around the Bun\u2019ei era (1264-1275). It consists of six scrolls, each in a different hand, the backs of which are covered with detailed annotations, known as the uragaki, or back writing. \n The Great Mirror (Okagami), a late eleventh-century or twelfth-century work, does indeed belong to a genre called rekishi monogatari by modern scholars. Leaving aside for the moment the precise meaning of the term rekishi monogatari, we can say that it refers to a type of history (rekishi), and that there is much in the content of The Great Mirror to support the classification. The book can be viewed as an account of the rise of an aristocratic family, the Fujiwara, from its seventh-century inception to its zenith in the career of its most conspicuously successful member, Michinaga (966-1027), who dominated the Court from 995 until his death, acting for many years as principal minister, and wielding de facto power, through martial and family connections, as the father-in-law of three Emperors, one Crown Prince, and one Retired Emperor; the grandfather of an Emperor and a Crown Prince; and the father of a Regent.",

            "Book Description": "From Introduction: Written in 1720, The Love Suicide at Amijima is a mature work of Monzaemon\u2019s late years and is considered by modern Japanese scholars to be the finest example of his domestic plays, or sewamono, a form which is largely his invention. The esteem in which this work is held in the history of Japanese literature is indicated by the fact that there have been more commentaries written on this than on any other play. \nThe plot concerns the ill-conceived love of the young owner of a paper store, a married man with children, and a prostitute. The lovers, unable to extricate themselves from their family and professional obligations so that they may marry, escape the unsympathetic world by seeking death in a double suicide. The plot as a whole is well integrated, and the details of the story are unfolded in a natural manner. Unexpected complications in the course of events hold the reader\u2019s attention; variety of action sustains the pace. The flow of events seems logical, and the main characters have a tragic quality. In fact, the social and ethical dilemma of the lovers, seems to deal with a universal experience.",

            "Book Description": "From preface: A study of Japanese literary and art theories will be useful in two significant ways. First, and obviously, it will help the reader gain a deeper understanding of Japanese literature and art. By learning about the philosophies of art in Japan, they will come to know the aims and methods with which the Japanese produced paintings, music, plays, novels and poems. As it happens, many of the major Japanese aestheticians were also great artists, so the person who carefully examines their theories of art will be rewarded with a glimpse into the secret of their creative achievements too. In this respect it is rather strange that Japanese aesthetics still remains a neglected subject in the West, where there is an increasing interesting Japanese art. \nSecondly, an examination of Japanese aesthetic ideas will contribute towards an international definition of art. Since ancient times numerous attempts have been made to answer the questions \u201cWhat is art?\u201d or \u201cWhat is literature?\u201d; yet in almost every case the answer has been formulated within a single cultural tradition. A definition of art that makes any claim to universality must be applicable to all arts, Oriental or Western. Japanese theories of art, which developed independently of Western culture, may provide a convenient touchstone by which to test the universal validity of a Western aesthetic concept.",

            "Book Description": "Japan: From Prehistory to Modern Times has a heavy emphasis upon the premodern period of Japanese history. No attempt has been made to provide the usual kind of textbook completeness. Hall\u2019s fascination with Japanese history lies within the manner in which Japan\u2019s political and social institutions have changed and diversified over time and how this fundamentally \u201cEastern\u201d culture gave rise to a modern world power.  Japan is today a modern nation in the full sense of the term. Yet its history is less familiar to us than the histories of those Western powers that it has now outstripped, or of the other countries of Asia that have gained recognition as the birthplaces of ancient civilizations or world religions. Japanese history does not force itself upon the world\u2019s attention as does the mainstream of European history or the exotic chronicles of China or India. Its significance has become apparent only in proportion to the recognition Japan has gained as a modern state and as scholars have begun to place Japanese history within a world context.",

Until now, however, no comprehensive critical discussion of the form has been available in a Western language. Masao Miyoshi offers an intensive reading of several outstanding novels of the past hundred years. He explains that the Japanese novel, usually regarded as basically Western in style, retains native elements that utterly resist Western influence. Citing Western, especially English, novels for comparison, he demonstrates how the Japanese novel differs in important formal aspects.",

            "Book Description": "This important study of Japan in premodern times, embracing a span of nearly thirteen centuries, is directed toward the illumination of some important elements of continuity in Japanese history. It is an effort to explain through the detailed analysis of a microcosm--the small province of Bizen--the fundamental institutions of political organization and social and economic structure upon which Japanese government has rested. It seeks historical depth both by limiting the study in terms of its geographical scope and by restricting the number of variables to which it gives attention.\u00a0This book deals chiefly with the combination of traditions and techniques by which the Japanese organized power and exercised authority and the connections between the holders of power and the sources of wealth, mainly land. Thus, Government and Local Power in Japan deals with such subjects as theories of legitimacy and practices of administration, concepts of social stratification and social rights, and practices of land tenure and taxation. It seeks to gain a sufficient intimacy with Japanese life to find meaning in the historic continuities and changes in the way premodern Japanese governed themselves.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Book Description": "The transition between the reign of the powerful Emperor Meiji and that of his weak successor Taisho was marked by the emergence of a new individualism in Japanese society, a separation of culture and politics that led to the demise of the traditional Japanese self-dedication to the interests of the state and to a corresponding dedication to modernization in all spheres of existence. The widespread social, political, economic, and cultural changes that occurred during the years of Japan's modernization movement in the early twentieth century are discussed in thirteen essays by Japanese and American scholars.\u00a0The contributors employ a diversity of disciplinary and historical approaches: the volume contains essays on intellectual, literary, economic, diplomatic, political, and social history covering the period from 1900 to 1945. The essays relate the new individualism of the Taisho years to such phenomena as literary naturalism, political socialism, the failure of economic expansion, and industrial and agricultural unrest.\u00a0\u00a0",

Minear challenges the world view behind the trial; links itto U.S. policy, particularly in Vietnam; and sharpens the argument on Nuremberg and the feasibility of war crimes trials. In the twenty-first century, as the United Nations undertakes war crimes proceedings in the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, and elsewhere, the issues raised here thirty years ago loom larger than ever.\u00a0\u00a0",

Their apparent rationality and empiricism suggest the distinction, long held in the West, between scientific thought and common sense, on the other hand, and religious thought, on the other, may be overdrawn.\nThe book also provides an impressive account of the variety of religious experiences and beliefs that have affected the villagers. That is, Yamanaka residents are described not only as Buddhists, or shamans, or Shintoists, or members of Kosei-kai, but also in their full, broad-based religious and ethnographic context. The reader is able to see the relationship of Buddhism and Shinto to each other and to the whole religious life of the individual villager. Thus, the logic, and apparent inconsistencies, in the belief systems of six Kosei-Kai members are laid bare.",

            "Book Description": "In A.D. 984 a scholarly Japanese author and bureaucrat, Minamoto Tamenori, created a collection of Buddhist tales for Sonshi, an imperial princess who had just taken vows as a nun. To this collection, designed for her religious edification, he gave the name Sanboe, or \u201cIllustrations of the Three Jewels,\u201d referring to the Buddha, the Buddhist teachings, and the community of Buddhist monks and nuns, and indicating that pictures would accompany the corresponding three \u201cvolumes\u201d of the text, perhaps in the format of a narrative picture scroll (emaki).\nThe illustrations, if ever produced, are now lost, but the text survives as one of the most intriguing contributions to the genre of Japanese Buddhist tale literature (Bukkyo setsuwa), offering many insights into the religion as it was understood from a literary lay perspective in the mid-Heian period. Tamenori drew his tales from Buddhist scripture, from earlier Japanese tale collections, and from historical and contemporary records. \nHe emphasized the rewards Sonshi could expect if she followed the examples of devotion practiced by the faithful men and women featured in the tales, and he argued that the tripartite Sanboe, \u201cgood at the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end,\u201d was far better for her to read than romances (monogatari), which, he warned, \u201chave such an effect upon ladies\u2019 hearts.\u201d",

            "Book Description": "A Japanese avant-garde poet who stood for cultural tolerance in a repressive, imperialistic age, Oguma Hideo cried out against the darkness that enveloped men\u2019s souls in the deepening twilight before World War II. He died in 1940 at the age of 39, but during his brief lifetime he published some of the most politically powerful poems ever written in Japan. \nOguma\u2019s best work displays an empathic vision and breadth of human concern unparalleled in Japanese poetry. He writes from the point of view of Chinese soldiers massacred by the Japanese forces, Ainu hunters trying to preserve their ethnic identity, and Korean grandmothers struggling in vain to preserve Korean culture under Japanese occupation. And, quite unusual for Japanese poets, who have tended to favor the shorter waka and haiku forms, Oguma excels at long poems with an epic-like quality. The present volume is the first sampling of his poetry in English.",

            "Book Description": "Bunraku drama has been recognized by many Western artists and scholars form early in this century as a fascinating theatrical tradition. While many have acknowledged the genius of this dramatic form, few have attempted to analyze the tradition in depth. This book is the first attempt to examine Bunraku in performance and to bring together musical, dramatic, and historical analyses into one study. \nThe Three authors focus on the famous \u201cMountains Scene\u201d (Yama no dan), the third scene of the third act of Mt. Imo and Mt. Se: An Exemplary Tale of Womanly Virtue (Imoseyama onna teikin, 1771) by Chikamatsu Hanji, to examine its place in the history of Bunraku and to analyze it as an example of a living tradition. By focusing on one text and on the music of one particular performance, the authors illuminate the rich musical and dramatic conventions that lie at the foundation of today\u2019s performance. \nThe book with its articles, translations, text, and glossary of terms is a complete guide to Bunraku as a performing tradition and will be useful to anyone interested in music or theater.",

            "Key Note": "A study of ways of reading some Japanese poems (waka) written by the woman known as \u201cthe Imperial Princess Senshi\u201d (Senshi Naishinno) or as \u201cthe Great Kamo Priestess Senshi\u201d (Daisaiin Senshi, or simply Daisaiin.)",
            "Book Description": "Senshi was born in 964 and died in 1035, in the Heian period of Japanese History (794-1185). Most of the poems discussed here are what may loosely be called Buddhist poems, since they deal with Buddhist scriptures, practices, and ideas. For this reason, most of them have been treated as examples of a category or subgenre of waka called Shakkyoka, \u201cBuddhist poems\u201d or more literally, \u201cpoems on, about, or relating to the teachings and practices of Buddhism.\u201d  \nThe very use of them term \u201cBuddhist poems,\u201d Shakkyoka, in reference to Senshi\u2019s poems suggests a certain way of reading those poems. But, one of the things this study will show is that such a reading, if too encumbered by notions about the classification or genre, may mask the very important fact that most of her poems (and many others so classified) are really more like other poems in the waka canon than they are unlike them. In the case of Senshi\u2019s \u201cBuddhist poems,\u201d especially the ones examined closely in this book, the links, through language, to the traditions of secular verse are explicit, and are very much in keeping with the expressed purpose of her project, which was to use the essentially secular public literary language of waka, of which she had considerable and widely acknowledge mastery, to address and express very serious and relatively private religious concerns and aspirations. In reading Senshi\u2019s poems, it is as important to think about their relationship to the traditions and conventions of waka and to other waka texts as it is to think about their relationship to Buddhist thoughts, practices, and texts.

            "Book Description": "These \"revelatory tales\" consist of firsthand accounts offered by groups of monks and nuns who tell and listen to each other's tales in turn, a public sharing that is, in fact, a religious ritual by which means the storytellers hope to confirm their beliefs and strengthen their religious resolve. Rethinking Sorrow is important reading for anyone interested in medieval Japanese literature and culture, in Buddhist didactic literature, and in homoerotic literature. It provides a private, personal look at the religious and literary world of late medieval Japan.   \nWhen applied to Japanese history, the term \u201cmedieval\u201d has traditionally referred to the Kamakura (1185-1333) and Muromachi (1333-1573) periods. This periodization, however, is based on political events that can be pinpointed precisely. Cultural developments, on the other hand, evolve gradually. Religious beliefs, for example, are not influenced by changes in political leadership. In considering literary phenomenon, periodization usually refers to the date when a text was written, compiled, or published. The times during which that text was widely read, however, may differ form when it first came into being and in certain ways may be the more relevant question.\nTwo of the tales treated here are Muromachi-period products, while the only extant texts of the other two tales date to the first decades of the Tokugawa or Edo (1600-1868) period. The designation \u201clate medieval\u201d in the title of this book is intentionally vague, being an attempt to refer to the Muromachi period plus the early years of the Edo period before the political and economic developments of that time stimulated very much cultural change.",

            "Book Description": "Conversations with Shotetsu represents the first attempt to translate and analyze the late medieval poetic miscellany titled Shotetsu monogatari. Written by a disciple of Shotetsu (1381-1459), whom many scholars regard as the last great poet of the courtly tradition, this work provides information about the practice of poetry during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  It contains anecdotes about famous ports, advice on how to treat certain standard topics, and lessons in etiquette when attending or participating in poetry contests and gatherings. But unlike the many other works of that time that stop at that level, Shotestsu\u2019s contributions to medieval aesthetics become most clear, showing him as a worthy heir\u2014both as poet and thinker\u2014to the legacy of the great poet-critic Fujiwara no Teika (1162-1241).\nThe translation, the last project of the late Robert H. Brower, is of the complete Nihon koten bungaku taikei text, edited by Hisamatsu Sen'ichi. Steven D. Carter has annotated the translation and provided an introduction that details Shotetsu's life, his place in the poetic circles of his day, and the relationship of his work to the larger poetic tradition of medieval Japan. Conversation with Shotetsu is important reading for anyone interested in medieval Japanese literature and culture, in poetry, and in aesthetics. It provides a unique look at the literary world of late medieval Japan.",

            "Book Description": "The Cult of Kasuga Seen Through Its Art is a study of the syncretic cult of Kasuga Shrine at its height in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries. Kasuga was the Shinto shrine of the Fujiwara clan and was paired with Kofuku-ji, the clan\u2019s Buddhist temple. Since the beginning of the Meiji period, Buddhism and Shinto have been officially separated. In an earlier time, however, at a site such as Kasuga the practices and beliefs appropriate to a shrine and to a temple were linked according to the pricnip0le that the Shinto gods were local and particular emanations of universal Buddhist deities. Thus the Buddhist deities and the paradises associated with them were present at Kasuga Shrine. \nThis study examines the relationships of the Buddhist and Shinto gods of Kasuga Shrine and explains the soteriological function of their presence at Kasuga. Using visual art as well as stories and documents, it brings to life a medieval shrine cult and defines its contribution to Japanese religion.",

            "Key Note": "A translation of Fujiwara Teika's only successful work of fiction.\u00a0",
            "Book Description": "Fujiwara Teika is known as the premier poet and literary scholar of the early thirteenth century. It is not so widely known that he also tried his hand at fiction: Mumy\u00f4z\u00f4shi (Untitled Leaves; ca. 1201) refers to \"several works\" by Teika and then names Matsura no miya monogatari (The Tale of Matsura; ca. 1190) as the only one that can be considered successful. The work is here translated in full, with annotation.\nSet in the pre-Nara period, \u201cThe Tale of Matsura\u201d is the story of a young Japanese courtier, Ujitada, who is sent to China with an embassy and has a number of supernatural experiences while there. In the first part of his sojourn, he learns the secrets of the zither from a princess with mystical powers. In the next part, he quells a violent rebellion against the Chinese throne with the help of the god of Sumiyoshi, who appears out of nowhere in the form of eight phantom warriors. In the final part of his stay, Ujitada has a dreamlike love affair with a mysterious lady who, among other things, vanishes into thin air even while he is holding her tightly in his embrace. The mysterious lady eventually reveals herself to be the empress dowager, de facto ruler of China since the end of the rebellion. The story ends with Ujitada\u2019s return to Japan. \nAffairs of the heart dominate \u201cThe Tale of Matsura,\u201d as is standard for courtly tales. Several of its other features break the usual mold, however: its time and setting; the military episode that would seem to belong instead in a war tale; scenes depicting the sovereign\u2019s daily audiences, in which formal court business is conducted; a substantial degree of specificity in referring to things Chinese; a heavy reliance on fantastic and supernatural elements; an obvious effort to avoid imitating The Tale of Genji as other late-Heian tales had done; and a most inventive ending. The discussion in the introduction briefly touches upon each of these features, and then focusses at some length on how characteristics associated with the poetic ideal of yoen inform the tale. Evidence relating to the date and authorship of the tale is explores in two appendixes.",

Composed by Japanese Zen monks who lived from the last quarter of the thirteenth century to the middle of the fifteenth century, these poems represent a portion of the best of the writing called in Japanese gozan bungaku, \"literature of the five mountains.\"\n\u201cFive mountains\u201d or \u201cfive monasteries\u201d refers to the system by which the Zen monasteries were hierarchically ordered and governed. For the monks in the monasteries, poetry functioned as a means not only of expressing religious convictions and personal feelings but also of communicating with others in a civilized and courteous fashion. Effacing barriers of time and space, the practice of Chinese poetry also made it possible for the Japanese authors to feel at one with their Chinese counterparts and the great poets of antiquity at a time when Zen as an institution became established and contact with the Chinese mainland became increasingly frequent\u2014ten of the sixteen poets represented here visited China. \nMarian Ury has provided a short but substantial introduction to the Chinese poetry of Japanese gozan monasteries, and her translations of the poetry are masterful. Poems of the Five Mountains is an important work for anyone interested in Japanese literature, Chinese literature, East Asian Religion, and Zen Buddhism.",

In keeping with Seidensticker\u2019s own eclectic work, the approached range from scholarly to discursive to whimsical, and the genres examined or translated include prose fiction ancient and modern, medieval and modern literary criticism, kanbun diaries, Edo and modern poetics, Shinnai ballads, modern poetry, and critical essays.

            "Key Note": "The poetic voice of one of Japan's greatest twentieth-century poets",
            "Book Description": "Kurihara Sadako was born in Hiroshima in 1913, and she was there on August 6, 1945. Already a poet before she experienced the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, she used her poetic talents to describe the blast and its aftermath. In 1946, despite the censorship of the American Occupation, she published Kuroi tamago (Black Eggs), poems from before, during, and immediately after the war. This volume includes a translation of Kuroi tamago (the complete edition of 1983). \nBut August 6, 1945, is not the end point of Kurihara\u2019s journey. Far from it. In the years after Kuroi tamago she has broadened her focus\u2014to Japan as a victimizer rather than victim, to the threat of nuclear war, to antiwar movements around the world, and to inhumanity in its many guises. She treats events in Japan\u2014for example, politics in Hiroshima, Tokyo\u2019s long-term complicity in American policies, and the decision in 1992 to send Japanese troops on U.N. peacekeeping operations\u2014but she also deals with the Vietnam War, Three Mile Island, Kwangju, Greenham Common, and Tiananmen Square. This volume includes a large selection of these later poems. \nKurihara sets us all at ground zero, strips us down to our basic humanity, and shows us the world both as it is and as it could be. Her poems are by turns sorrowful and sarcastic, tender and tough. Several of them are famous in Japan today, but even there few people appreciate the full force and range of her poetry. And few poets in any country\u2014indeed, few artists of any kind\u2014have displayed a comparable dedication, consistency, and insight.",

            "Key Note": "An exploration of the timeless appeal that the Soga story has exerted and the processes that took the brothers through successive incarnations in literature",
            "Book Description": "For six centuries the Soga vendetta was Japan's archetypal revenge tragedy, and the Soga brothers epitomized heroic avengers, dedicated yet doomed.  In avatars of Vengeance Laurence Kominz presents the grand panorama of this saga. It began in 1193 with a politically unimportant assassination, but the murder so captured the imagination of the Japanese that, by the fourteenth century, wandering minstrels throughout the nation were reciting highly embellished oral tales of the vendetta. The most dramatic versions of the Soga story were created for the stage\u2014Noh, kowakamai, puppet theater, and Kabuki. Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Japan\u2019s greatest playwright revitalized the tradition in his thirteen Soga plays (1683-1718), and by the mid-eighteenth century the Soga story had become the most popular subject for Kabuki plays in Edo, plays that linked religious rituals and secular entertainment in new ways. \nAvatars of Vengeance explores the timeless appeal that the Soga story has exerted on the Japanese and describes the processes that took the brothers through successive incarnations in literature. Beginning as loyal samurai, they changed into Shinto gods, then exemplars of filial virtue, suave dandies, superhuman swashbucklers, sensitive lovers, and back into gods again. The heroines of the story also underwent changes, from exemplars of religious devotion in the medieval, oral tale to icons of romantic love and models of secular virtue in later versions. The most startling transformations in the Soga story and its characters took place on stage as theater changed and developed, fueled by the tastes of succeeding generations of audiences and new methods of stage presentation, by advances in performers' training and technique, and by changing religious attitudes toward the Soga deities. Kominz explains why plays about the Soga revenge so often marked new directions in dramaturgy and play writing. His study demonstrates that no dramatic theme better illuminates the dynamics of creativity in traditional Japanese theater than the Soga vendetta.\n",

            "Key Note": "A turn-of-the-century novel from one of the giants of modern Japanese literature",
            "Book Description": "Mori Ogai (1862-1922), one of the giants of modern Japanese literature, wrote The Wild Goose at the turn of the century. Set in the early 1880s, it was, for contemporary readers, a nostalgic return to a time when the nation was embarking on an era of dramatic change. Ogai\u2019s narrator is a middle-aged man reminiscing about an unconsummated affair, dating to his student days, between his classmate and a young woman kept by a moneylender. At a time when writers tended to depict modern, alienated male intellectuals, the characters of The Wild Goose are diverse, including not only students preparing for a privileged intellectual life and members of the plebeian classes who provide services to them, but also a pair of highly developed female characters. The author's sympathetic and penetrating portrayal of the dilemmas and frustrations faced by women in this early period of Japan's modernization makes the story of particular interest to readers today. \nOgai was not only a prolific and popular writer, but also a protean figure in early modern Japan: critic, translator, physician, military officer, and eventually Japan\u2019s Surgeon General. His rigorous and broad education included the Chinese classics as well as Dutch and German; he gained admittance to the Medical School of Tokyo Imperial University at the age of only fifteen. Once established as a military physician, he was sent to Germany for four years to study aspects of European medicine still unfamiliar to the Japanese. Upon his return, he produced his first works of fiction and translations of English and European literature. Ogai\u2019s writing is extolled for its unparalleled style and psychological insight, nowhere better demonstrated than in The Wild Goose.",

            "Book Description": "It is as a scholar, especially of the Tale of Genji and other texts of the classical Japanese canon, that Ichijo Kaneyoshi (1402-81) is now remembered, when he is remembered at all. Yet in his own time he was much more than that: the heir of a venerable court lineage, a poet and patron of artists and literati, a master of esoteric lore and doctrine, and a statesman and politician very much engaged in the contests and discourses of his time. Kaneyoshi was born into an era of relative prosperity for the court. Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, one of the most courtly of shoguns, was in firm control of the government, in the Kyoto area at least, and Kaneyoshi's own father was serving as imperial regent. In succeeding years, however, the court and its families were severely tested by political, economic, and social exigencies beyond their control. \nThe response of some to the turbulence of the world around them was to withdraw into seclusion; Kaneyoshi, as the head of one of the five houses of the regency, seems never to have considered that option. Instead, he dedicated himself totally to the active maintenance of his heritage. In his early years, this meant competing for office with colleagues at court, providing for a large family and supporting the cause of courtly art and ceremony with his position, his influence, and his resources, both literal and symbolic. Later, when the continued existence of the imperial court and its families was put in jeopardy by events such as the Onin War (1467-77), Kaneyoshi dedicated himself to a number of \u201cconservative\u201d tasks\u2014from the writing of commentaries and handbooks to the instruction of the shogun in how to return the nation to order. Still, he remained active in political affairs, never losing hope in an eventual resurgence in the fortunes of the court. \nThroughout, this story is told through reference to primary sources, most prominently Sino-Japanese (kanbun) journals left by Kaneyoshi\u2019s contemporaries and his own writings. Included here are some excerpts from one of his most famous essays.",

            "Book Description": "The subject of modern Japanese poetry written in support of the nation\u2019s wars, long considered a taboo in postwar literary circles, is explored here in historical and cultural context. Steve Rabson presents translations and explications of works by poets who wrote both for and against war, and provides background essential for understanding why some of Japan's most famous writers swung 180 degrees to support or oppose war at different times in their careers. Through examples from American and British poetry, Rabson also shows that this phenomenon of poets changing their views is by no means exclusive to Japan. Exposing the efforts of some Japanese writers after 1945 to conceal or revise their poetry written during World War II, the author discusses assertions by literary critics and historians that poets bear a special \u201cwar responsibility.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Key Note": "Stories that probe the human dramas of growing up and growing old",
            "Book Description": "Furui Yoshikichi deals with the human dramas of growing up and growing old, but by probing further into the recesses of the mind and memory, he touches upon the deepest mysteries of human existence. As if to balance the somber themes of madness and death, Furui also shows a great sensitivity to the dark humor inherent in everyday life.\nYoko (winner of the Akutagawa Prize in 1971) is the story of a sensitive young man\u2019s relationship with the title character, a beautiful young woman who is suffering from an apparently hereditary mental illness that defies precise diagnosis but is clearly linked to the traumatic transition from carefree child to responsible adult. Through Yoko\u2019s vivid but distorted perceptions of the world, Furui highlights the process by which reality and identity are created. Above all, however, Yoko is a touching, if somewhat unusual, tale of a young couple\u2019s deepening love.\nThe other two short stories in this collection, \u201cThe Plain of Sorrows\u201d and \u201cThe Doll,\u201d deal with the subject of coming to terms with aging and death, thus shifting the focus from the crises of young adulthood to those approaching middle age.   \nFurui explores a range of human experiences on the borderline between life and death, the present and the past. Here, in particular, we find a surprisingly vital legacy of the literature and culture of premodern Japan coexisting with the concrete and commuter trains of Japan today.",
            "Author Display Name": "Furui Yoshikichi; Translated with an Introduction and Critical Commentaries by Donna George Stacey",
            "Author Bio": "Furui Yoshikichi was born in 1937 in Tokyo. He received both a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in German literature from Tokyo University, and after graduation he spent several years as a university instructor, publishing translations of the works of the Austrian writers Hermann Broch and Robert Musil. By the late 1960s his own work was being widely published in major literary magazines, and in 1971 his novella Yoko (translated as the lead work in this collection) won the Akutagawa Prize. Furui has also won the Nihon Bungaku Taisho (1980), the Tanizaki Prize (1983), the Kawabata Yasunari Prize (1988), and the Yomiuri Prize (1989). \nFurui is generally regarded as the leading writer of the naiko no sedai, \u201cIntroverted Generation,\u201d a group of Japanese novelists who made their debut in the early 1970s and who focused on the apparently unremarkable dramas of ordinary people, but, in so doing, undertook a search for the extraordinary, the \u201cunreal\u201d and irrational that lurks behind the surface of everyday life. Furui\u2019s concern with the inner life, the very mechanics of perception, cognition, and memory through which we create subjective reality, continues to be apparent in his later works.\nToday, twenty-six years after he won the Akutagawa Prize, Furui has taken his place as one of the senior members of the literary establishment and serves on the committee that awards the prize to the current generation of talented young writers. Yet he remains virtually unknown in the West. This translation of Yoko, Aihara (\u201cThe Plain of Sorrows\u201d), and Ningyo (\u201cThe Doll\u201d) makes the work of this important contemporary writer available to an English-reading audience.\nDonna George Storey received her Ph.D. in Japanese Literature from Stanford University in 1993 and has been a Visiting Assistant Professor in Japanese Literature at the University of California, Berkeley, since 1994. In addition to the present volume, she has translated several articles for scholarly works and has written the entry on Furui Yoshikichi for the Encyclopedia of World Literature in the 20th Century.",

            "Key Note": "A fascinating woman's diary from tenth-century Japan.",
            "Book Description": "Japan is the only country in the world where it was primarily the works of women writers that laid the foundation for the classical literary tradition, and the Kagero Diary commands our attention the first extant work of that rich and brilliant tradition. The author, known to posterity as Michitsuna\u2019s Mother, a member of the middle-ranking aristocracy of the Heian period (794-1185), wrote an account of twenty years of her life (from 954-974), and this autobiographical text now gives readers access to a woman\u2019s experience of a thousand years ago.\nThe author\u2019s account of her life centers on her relationship with her husband, Fujiwara Kaneie, her kinsman from a more powerful and prestigious branch of the family than her own. Their marriage ended in divorce, and one of the author\u2019s intentions seems seems to have been to write an anti-romance, one that could be subtitled, \u201cI married the prince but we did not live happily ever after.\u201d Yet, particularly in the first part of the diary, Michitsuna\u2019s Mother is drawn to record those events and moments when the marriage did live up to a romantic ideal fostered by the Japanese tradition of love poetry. At the same time, another trajectory of the diary is toward finding the freedom to live and write outside the romance myth and without a husband. \nSince the author was by inclination and talent a poet and lived in a time when poetry was a part of everday social inrercourse, her account of her life is shaped by a lyrical consciousness. The poems she records are crystalline moments of awareness that vividly recall the past. The diary, then, is an exquisitely beautiful text in which the domestic and the poetic dovetail. While the reader will find much of interest in this text from a historical and anthropological point of view, this information is embedded in a consummately literary text where there is pleasure in watching the author grow both as a human being and as a writer. \nThis new translation of the Kagero Diary conveys the long, fluid sentences, the complex polyphony of voices, and the floating temporality of the original. It also pays careful attention to the poems of the text, rendering as much as possible their complex imaginary and open-ended quality. The translation is accompanied by running notes on facing pages and an introduction that places the work within the context of contemporary discussions regarding feminist literature and the genre of autobiography and provides detailed historical information and a description of the stylistic qualities of the text.",

            "Book Description": "The field of Japanese literary studies in the United States is barely half a century old, and the number of scholars whose work has had a lasting impact on the contours of the field is still very small. As a translator and critic, Edwin, McClellan has indelibly marked the sensibilities of all scholars of Japanese literature; as a teacher, his contribution to the field has no equal. \nIn Studies in Modern Japanese Literature, twenty-one students honor their mentor with essays and translations focusing on literature from the late nineteenth through the late twentieth centuries. The authors discussed range from Natsume Soseki to Murakami Haruki, and subjects discussed include the flourishing of literary forms in response to the Ansei earthquake, the impact of Western styles on Japanese literature, and modern poetry. Together with the translations of short stories, fables, and a critical essay, these contributions provide an overview of modern Japanese literary history. \nEdwin McClellan is a demanding teacher and scholar, but his approach is neither rigid nor doctrinaire. There is no better evidence of his generosity of spirit than the diversity represented by the essays and translations in this volume.",

            "Book Description": "This is the first monograph-length study in English of Kamo no Chomei, one of the most important literary figures of medieval Japan. Drawing upon a wide range of writings in a variety of genres from the Heian and Kamakura periods, Pandey shows how the terms kyogen kigo (wild words and fancy phrases), shoji soku nehan (samsara is nirvana), hoben (expedient means), and suki (single-minded devotion to an art) were deployed by writers in an attempt to reconcile literary and artistic activities with a commitment to Buddhism. By locating Chomei within this broad context, the book offers an original reading of his texts, while at the same time casting a light upon intellectual preoccupations that were central to the times. \nWriting and Renunciation in Medieval Japan is an important contribution to a growing body of work that challenges the rigid distinction between the religious and literary-- a distinction that would have made little sense to medieval writers, many of whom were poets as well as priests-- and sheds light on the particular ways in which a religio-aesthetic tradition came to be articulated in medieval Japan. Through an examination of records left by Chomei\u2019s contemporaries, the book also traces the life of Chomei, particularly his activities as a court poet and the circumstances that led to his taking the tonsure.",

            "Book Description": "Ooka Shohei (1909-88) was a distinguished member of the Japanese literary establishment for more than four decades following the end of the Pacific War. While the war was the defining experience for Ooka, his work exhibits enormous range and depth. The Shade of Blossoms, for which he was honored in 1961 with both the Mainichi and the Shincho literary prizes, marks an especially important stage in his development as an artist. In his postscript Ooka describes this story as a novel of manners, and certainly the setting of the novel, the demimonde of the Ginza bar scene in the 1950s, and its subject, the aging bar hostess Yoko, seem far removed from the universe of battle. Nonetheless, The Shade of Blossoms not only shares key elements of style but also extends in important ways the moral concerns of his earlier works.\nThe Shades of Blossoms provides a disturbing view of lives at the margins of Japanese society. Ooka\u2019s is a powerfully ethical literature that describes the inner search for meaning and identity in a world where received values have been disrupted by war or by social upheavals. His moral imagination is uncompromising and disturbing, and his emotional intelligence is matched by few postwar writers.",
            "Author Display Name": "Ooka Shohei; Translated with an Introduction by Dennis Washburn",
            "Author Bio": "Ooka Shohei was a prolific writer and active translator of French literature, most notably the novels of Stendahl. A protege of the influential critic Kobayashi Hideo (1902-83), Ooka secured his reputation with such works as the novel Fires on the Plain and the memoir Taken Captive: A Japanese POW\u2019s Story that recount his experiences as a soldier in the Philippines during World War II. A number of his contemporaries, including the novelists Mishima Yukio and Oe Kenzaburo, have expressed considerable admiration for Ooka, ranking him among the finest artists of modern Japanese literature.\nDennis Washburn is Associate Professor in the Departments of Asian and Middle Eastern Languages and Literatures, Dartmouth College.

The essays have been significantly revised for this publication. Topics include Tanizaki's fiction, plays, and film scenarios; his aesthetics; his place in Japanese intellectual history; his depiction of the West; his use of humor; and film adaptations of his works.\u00a0In 1964 Tanizaki was elected to honorary membership in the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, the first Japanese to be so honored; and it is widely believed that he was being considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\u00a0",

            "Book Description": "Women and Class in Japanese History marks an important moment not only in the study of gender and women in Japanese society but also in the development of collaborative efforts between Japanese and Western scholars on the subject. It is a product of half a decade of international seminars and discussions held among scholars of various disciplines and perspectives who share the goal of promoting a better understanding of the historical and contemporary constructions of gender in Japan. Their conclusions, presented in the fourteen essays in this volume, will attract people interested both in the history of Japan and the history of women.\nThe Ann Arbor conference, organized by Hitomi Tonomura on the U.S. side, was a component of a larger, ongoing Gender and Culture Project inaugurated in 1990 by Wakita Haruko, who was also the organizer of this conference on the Japanese side. Conferences held in Japan from 1991 through 1993, which many of the Ann Arbor conference participants also attended, led to the publication of an essay collection, Jendaa no Nihonshi (Gender in Japanese History), in Japanese in 1994. Anne Walthall joined the two conference organizers as an editor to share the responsibility of bringing the present volume to fruition.",

            "Book Description": "The inflectional morphology of the classical Japanese of the Heian period (794-1185) is markedly different from that of modern standard Japanese. In particular, five temporal and aspectual suffixes, -ki, -keri, -ri, -nu, and -tu, have disappeared, and a sixth, -tari, has evolved into the modern past and perfective suffix -ta. This study documents the changes in these six suffixes by examining their usage in literary works from the Heian period through the Kamakura period (1185-1334) and most of the Muromachi period (1114-1615). \nIn her work, Karen E. Sandness succeeds in (1) presenting an internally consistent and workable analysis of classical Japanese suffixes, (2) explaining the evidence for the evolution and disappearance of these suffixes, and (3) pointing out the ways in which the dialectological and literary evidence support and contradict each other. Suffixes is important reading for those interested in Japanese language and linguistics. It will also aid scholars and students in reading and understanding various aspects of classical Japanese.",

            "Book Description": "Essays on the Modern Japanese Church (Gendai Nihon kyokai shiron) , by Yamaji Aizan, published in 1906, was the first Japanese-language history of Christianity in the Meiji period. Yamaji Aizan\u2019s firsthand account describes the reintroduction of Christianity to Japam-- its development, rapid expansion, and decline-- and its place in the social, political, and intelectual life of the Meiji period. Yamaji\u2019s overall argument is that Christianity played a crucial role in shaping the growth and development of modern Japan.\nYamaji was a strong opponent of the government-sponsored \"emperor-system ideology,\" and through his historical writing he tried to show how Japan had a tradition of tolerance and openness at a time when government-sponsored intellectuals were arguing for greater conformity and submissiveness to the state on the basis of Japanese \"national character.\"\nEssays is important not only in terms of religious history but also because it highlights broad trends in the history of Meiji Japan. Introductory chapters explore the significance of the work in terms of the life and thought of its author and its influence on subsequent interpretations of Meiji Christianity.",

            "Book Description": "Yosano Akiko (1878-1942) has long been recognized as one of the most important literary figures of prewar Japan. Hitherto she has been renowned principally for the passion of her early poetry and for her contributions to twentieth-century debates about women. This emphasis obscures a major part of her career, which was devoted to work on the Japanese classics and, in particular, the great Heian period text The Tale of Genji. Akiko herself felt that Genji was the bedrock upon which her entire literary career was built, and her bibliography shows a steadily increasing amount of time devoted to projects related to the tale. This study traces for the first time the full range of Akiko's involvement with The Tale of Genji.\u00a0\nThe Tale of Genji provided Akiko with her conception of herself as a writer and inspired many of her most significant literary projects. She, in turn, refurbished Genji as a modern novel, pioneered some of the most promising avenues of modern academic research on Genji, and, to a great extent, gave the text the prominence it now enjoys as a translated classic. Through her work Genji became, in fact as well as in name, an exemplum of that most modern of literary genres, the novel. In delineating this important aspect of Akiko's life and her bibliography, this study aims to show that facile descriptions of Akiko as a \"poetess of passion\" or \"new woman\" will no longer suffice.",

            "Book Description": "Izumi Kyoka (1873-1939) had a predilection for the richly figurative and supernatural that seemed not only irrelevant to the concerns of modern life but an affront to the social and psychological realism that became the common currency of both literature and theater in modern Japan. Believing in beauty and truth and in language's mystical evocation of experience, Kyoka sought for a way to reinvest the world with a kind of magic that he felt was being lost. Although better known as a novelist, Kyoka also wrote a large number of plays, and his work has continued to be adapted by others for the stage and screen.\u00a0Spirits of Another Sort, the first work in any language to focus on Izumi Kyoka's career as a playwright, argues that the dramas reveal, in an often unmitigated fashion, the writer's romanticism, his belief in the occult, his aversion to contemporary society, and his idiosyncratic but powerful ethical and aesthetic ideals. In an attempt to create a dramaturgy of the sacred from the dregs of the past, Kyoka's plays resemble the work of Maeterlinck or even Artaud.\u00a0Spirits of Another Sort is a literary-critical study that traces the development of Kyoka's work from the melodramatic formulas of his early ideological fiction to the increasingly grotesque and fantastic permutations of the original pattern in his plays of the Taisho era. It is important reading for those whose interests lie in Japanese literature, theater, and film and in cross-cultural theater and film.",

The miseries depicted in Brueghel's work seem in retrospect to encapsulate all the miseries the main character has suffered since seeing his friends: persecution, self-doubt, sexual anxiety, warfare, imprisonment, bombardment, and the miseries of life in Japan after the defeat.\u00a0The other two stories are set in the postwar world of black marketeers and bombsites, but they too concern young men whose universal anxieties about sexual desires and their place in the world are overshadowed by memories of the brutality of war.\u00a0",

Miyake defines folk religion as \u201creligion that merges from the necessities of community life.\u201d In Miyake's systematic methodological and theoretical approach, Shugendo is a classic example of Japanese folk religion, for it blends many traditions (shamanism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shinto) into a distinctive Japanese religious worldview and is typical of Japanese religion generally. \nThe first part of this book is devoted to Shugendo's history, organization, ritual, austerities, thought, and cosmology. Related subjects include exorcism and the exclusion of women. The second part of the book provides research and reflection on Japanese folk religion, including essays on the idea of nature, worldly benefits, new religions, death and rebirth, and the structure of folk religion.",

            "Book Description": "Published serially between 1928 and 1931, Shanghai tells the story of a group of Japanese expatriates living in the International Settlement at the time of the May 30th Incident of 1925. The personal lives and desires of the main characters play out against a historical backdrop of labor unrest, factional intrigue, colonialist ambitions, and racial politics. \nThe author, Yokomitsu Riichi (1898-1947), was an essayist, writer, and critical theorist who became one of the most powerful and influential literary figures in Japan during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1924 Yokomitsu joined with Kataoka Teppei and Kawabata Yasunari to found the Shinkankaku-ha (New Sensation School), artists who to contemporary avant-garde movements in Europe--Dadaism, futurism, surrealism, expressionism--for inspiration in his effort to explode the conventions of literary language and to break free of what he saw as the prisonhouse of modern culture. A key feature of the school\u2019s experiments was the use of jarring imagery that originated in the group\u2019s fascination with the visual effects of cinema.\nYokomitsu incorporated the striking visuality of his early experimental style into a realistic mode that presents a disturbing picture of a city in turmoil. The result is a brilliant evocation of Shanghai as a gritty ideological battleground and as an exotic landscape where dreams of sexual and economic domination are nurtured.",

He presents a new hypothesis regarding the relationship between the main verb conjugations of eighth-century Japanese and an earlier, primary division between vowel-final and consonant-final roots.\nThe author then reviews the research on the internal reconstruction of Korean. Consonantal vocalization, the vowel system of Middle Korean, and competing hypotheses about the origins of the Korean vowel system and the pitch accent system of Middle Korean are addressed. Whitman concludes either that there was an extensive, earlier period of close contact between the Japanese and Korean peoples, or that Japanese and Korean have a common linguistic ancestor, or that their shared vocabulary and other common linguistic traits result from a combination of these two scenarios.",

            "Book Description": "The American draft of the Japanese Constitution included an article expressing that each individual was entitled to respect simply by virtue of being a human being. The Japanese, however, interpreted this concept as \"respect for jinkaku (moral character).\"\nJinkaku was a strongly elitist concept that gradually acquired more egalitarian meanings during the Taisho period. Yet the hierarchical connotations were still present when the term was used to interpret \"individual dignity\" in the Constitution and was later made the foundation of postwar Japanese education. As Japanese discourse began to embrace the American idea that all people are worthy of respect just because they are human beings, and thus their fundamental rights must be protected, it did not adopt the American emphasis on protecting individual rights against the government. Consonant with the ideas embodied in the Constitution, the Japanese teach that government and the people are jointly responsible for bringing about a fair and just society for all. Textbooks thus promote a communitarian rather than individualistic view of democracy.\nIndividual Dignity in Modern Japanese Thought is important for scholars of modern Japanese intellectual history and Japanese democracy, for political scientists interested in political socialization, and for scholars of comparative history, law, politics, and education.",

            "Book Description": "Takebe Ayatari (1719-74), a contemporary of Yosa Buson and Ike no Taiga, was born into a powerful military household, but rejected his martial background and devoted his prodigious talents to the arts. By his death on the road at the age of fifty-six, Ayatari had succeeded in pioneering fresh approaches to a variety of aesthetic activities, including haikai and waka poetry, prose fiction, travel literature, and especially painting. Not content with his writings and ink drawings, Ayatari made special efforts to publish his and his disciples' works, thereby single-handedly breaking new ground in the woodblock publishing industry.\nWhile Ayatari's life provides fascinating reading in its own right, this study goes on to provide a detailed background to the cultural and intellectual world of the bohemian in eighteenth-century Japan. The author draws upon a wealth of details to bring the reader a rich view of life for the individualist thriving in a conformist-oriented society. The large number of illustrations of Ayatari's beautiful landscape and bird-and-flower paintings and woodblock painting manuals, many of which are shown for the first time anywhere, enhances the visual quality of the book for the generalist and specialist alike.\n",

            "Book Description": "Murakami Haruki has become one of the most important voices in contemporary Japanese literature, gaining a following in the United States through translations of his works. In Dances with Sheep Matthew Strecher examines Murakami's fiction--and, to a lesser extent, his nonfiction--for its most prevalent structures and themes. Strecher also delves into the paradoxes in Murakami's writings that confront critics and casual readers alike. Murakami writes of \"serious\" themes yet expresses them in a relatively uncomplicated style that appeals to high school students as well as scholars; and his fictional work appears to celebrate the pastiche of postmodern expression, yet he rejects the effects of the postmodern on contemporary culture as dangerous. \nStrecher's methodology is both historical and cultural as he utilizes four distinct yet interwoven approaches to analyze Murakami's major works: the writer's \"formulaic\" structure with serious themes; his play with magical realism; the intense psychological underpinnings of his literary landscape; and his critique of language and its capacity to represent realities, past and present. Dances with Sheep links each of these approaches with Murakami's critical focus on the fate of individual identity in contemporary Japan. The result is that the simplicity of the Murakami hero, marked by lethargy and nostalgia, emerges as emblematic of contemporary humankind, bereft of identity, direction, and meaning. Murakami's fiction is reconstructed in Dances with Sheep as a warning against the dehumanizing effects of late-model capitalism, the homogenization of the marketplace, and the elimination of effective counterculture in Japan.",

            "Book Description": "As a spokesman for disaffected youth of the post-1960s, Etsuko Terasaki considers the powerful religious-ideological role that Buddhism and the social and economic aspects of Kamakura and early Muromachi society played in framing the status of women in the Noh plays of the period. In a world where social norms break down, the identity of women is fragmented or divided (spirit possession), resulting in madness, being sold into slavery, torture, and even deification. Figures of Desire also examines earlier folk legends that were appropriated into the new construct of Noh as evidence of cultural and ideological shifts or displacements.\u00a0\nThrough a close critical reading of the Noh texts, Terasaki deals with topics such as sexuality, desire, fantasy, madness, spirit possession, and mourning, aspects of Noh drama that have been ignored in previous commentary. With an analysis of the language of the plays, she examines the intricacy and complexity of the rhetorical presentation. The author also utilizes contemporary literary theory.\u00a0\nFigures of Desire opens up new perspectives on Noh drama that may be of interest to religious-cultural studies, feminist studies, dramatic literature, and literary history. The book will appeal to teachers and students of literature, theater, and religion; to those in interdisciplinary and humanities programs; and to general readers interested in classical Noh theater of Japan.",

            "Key Note": "A treasure trove of diplomatics and epistolary stylistics of late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Japan.",
            "Book Description": "The Great Grammar of the Japanese Language (Arte da lingoa de Japam) was written by the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jo\u00e3o Rodriguez (1561-1633) and printed by the Jesuit mission press in Nagasaki between 1604 and 1608. The grammar is a veritable treasure house of information about the Japanese language in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and particularly the language of polite society. Rodriguez spent thirty-three years in Japan and was probably the European most proficient at speaking and reading the Japanese of his day. \nJapanese epistolary style, or sorobun, is one of the topics dealt with by Rodriguez. Rodriguez explains in his \u201cTreatise on Epistolary Style\u201d what kind of letters there are and their names, the set phrases that are used, how a letter is divided into its component parts, how to interpret the physical layout of a letter, and how the level of politeness can be determined. Rodriguez deals extensively with the courtesies for the Buddhist clergy, and he proposes an adaptation of these forms so that they can be used for and by Jesuit missionaries in Japan. Finally, Rodriguez provides a large number of sample letters. \nThe \"Treatise on Epistolary Style\" has a twofold utility for modern readers. First, it is an excellent instrument for dissecting Japanese letters from the early-modern era into their component parts. Second, it can help to make apparent the valuable historical and social clues that are often hidden in what appear to be trivial epistolary details. Once one understands the principles of the Japanese epistolary style, with its subtle social nuances and minute gradations of courtesies, much more information can be obtained from early-modern documents than their factual contents alone.",

            "Book Description": "First published in Japan in 1983, this book is now a classic in modern Japanese literature studies. Covering an astonishing range of texts from the Meiji period (1868-1912), it presents sophisticated analyses of the ways that experiments in literary language produced multiple new--and sometimes revolutionary--forms of sensibility and subjectivity. Along the way, Kamei Hideo carries on an extended debate with Western theorists such as Saussure, Bakhtin, and Lotman, as well as with such contemporary Japanese critics as Karatani Kojin and Noguchi Takehiko.\u00a0Transformations of Sensibility deliberately challenges conventional wisdom about the rise of modern literature in Japan and offers highly original close readings of works by such writers as Futabatei Shimei, Tsubouchi Shoyo, Higuchi Ichiyo, and Izumi Kyoka, as well as writers previously ignored by most scholars. It also provides a new critical theorization of the relationship between language and sensibility, one that links the specificity of Meiji literature to broader concerns that transcend the field of Japanese literary studies.\u00a0Available in English translation for the first time, it includes a new preface by the author and an introduction by the translation editor that explain the theoretical and historical contexts in which the work first appeared.\u00a0",

            "Book Description": "Using local geographies of the Kanto region as a basis for her study, Helen Hardacre presents a statistical portrait of the religious institutions existing in Koza County of Sagami Province and the Western Tama area of Musashi Province in the years from roughly 1830 to 1840. She then interprets this data to provide the social setting for these religious institutions by supplementing the statistical portrait derived from the geographies, first with an examination of the legal framework governing religious institutions during the Edo period, and then with case studies of four significant religious sites in the survey area. The dynamics of the institutional organization of these four sites are analyzed, with attention to the relations among temples and shrines and to the development of the shrine priesthood. This analysis is further supplemented with a discussion of popular religious life centering on the temples and shrines of the survey area at the end of the Edo period.\u00a0Religion and Society in Nineteenth-Century Japan offers extensive and concrete detail for the complex institutional ways in which Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines were interwoven and interpenetrated in the late Edo period, and for the specific and equally complex ways in which this whole system was transformed in the Meiji period. The book also details the economic basis of institutional religions, the relative roles and strengths of various Buddhist sects, and the ritualization of sericulture.\u00a0\u00a0",

France has been an important source of energy for Japanese intellectual endeavors, and the impact of French painting, literature, and thought on Japan, from even before the Meiji Revolution, cannot be overstated. Likewise, France has been stimulated by an image of Japan as \"Other\" and as a model to American cultural hegemony. The impact of Japanese prints on French (and European) art, the related artistic production collected under the heading of 'Japonisme,' and the creative responses to Japanese poetic and dramatic forms are profound.\u00a0\nConfluences details these exchanges and outlines the ground from which they proceed. In doing so, the authors elucidate much of the development of national and individual identities, especially as filtered through the artistic endeavors of a culture.",

Richly illustrated and with a comprehensive list of characters, Engendering Faith is must reading for anyone interested in premodern Japanese history, culture, and religion.",

            "Key Note": "Examines a wide range of grammatical categories in terms of both modal and propositional content--namely, modal auxiliaries, aspectual categories, and conditionals--and reveals a new approach to Japanese modality that relies more centrally on concepts developed in the study of English modality",
            "Book Description": "In English, the concept of modality has been the subject of studies crucial to the understanding and functioning of the language. Modality governs, for example, the choice of whether to use \"may,\" \"shall,\" or \"must\" as an auxiliary of the main verb in sentences. The study of these modal auxiliaries reveals the speaker's intention when making statements. Although modality for decades has been studied in Japanese as a field of Japanese linguistics, its study has been historically unfocused, and few articles or books have been written on it in English.\u00a0\nModality and the Japanese Language is innovative as an English-language text that examines a wide range of grammatical categories in terms of both modal and propositional content--namely, modal auxiliaries, aspectual categories, and conditionals--and reveals a new approach to Japanese modality that relies more centrally on concepts developed in the study of English modality. Yuki Johnson finds many practical and theoretical similarities between English and Japanese modal auxiliaries and argues that modality can be thought of as an expression of the degree of a speaker's conviction concerning a proposition's truth or realization in the form of possible/non-actual words. Such a definition provides practical and applicable perspective to the study of Japanese modality: propositions, for example, become objects of that study in the form of conditional sentences and aspectual categories.\nThis book will benefit scholars in Japanese linguistics and those engaged in research on the general theory of modals. It will also be helpful to language educators generally, graduate students, and students of advanced-level Japanese.",

            "Book Description": "Japanese Painting and National Identity is the first monograph in English to address the art and philosophy of a group of Meiji painters regarded by many as seminal figures in the development of modern Japanese painting. Lead by the outspoken and widely published art critic Okakura Tenshin, this group, including artists Yokoyama Taikan, Shimomura Kanzan, Hishida Shuns\u00f4, and others, wrestled with the vexing problem of how to modernize traditional media, methods, and styles while keeping the results authentically Japanese. Yet they saw themselves not just as artists but as servants of the nation. Their task, they believed, was to give expression to the vitality of Meiji Japan while also helping to shape public opinion at home and abroad. Okakura's circle of painters chose themes purposefully redolent with what they identified as Japanese cultural values; they experimented with painting techniques based on tradition yet revitalized through innovation. How they came to this mission, their training, their philosophical objectives, and the works of their constant invention are the subject of this book.\u00a0\nJapanese Painting and National Identity will be of interest to academics and museum professionals, as well as those who study Japanese culture and politics, Asian art, and cross-cultural currents connecting Japan to the West in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.",

            "Book Description": "State of War, a path-breaking study of the transformative power of war and its profound influence on fourteenth-century Japan, presents a fundamental revision of Japanese history. By illuminating Japan through the lens of war, Thomas Conlan provides insight into how state and society functioned, as opposed to how they were portrayed in ideal. Conlan recreates the experience of war from the perspective of one warrior, and then reconstructs how war was fought through statistical analysis of surviving casualty records.\u00a0\nState of War also shows that the battles of the fourteenth century mark a watershed in Japanese history. The fiscal exigencies of waging war led to a devolution of political power to the provinces. Furthermore, the outbreak of war caused social status to become performative, based upon the ability to fight autonomously, rather than being prescriptive, or determined by edicts of investiture. \nThis work bridges the intellectual gulf between the fourteenth and twentieth centuries by exploring how the seemingly contradictory categories of \"religion\" and \"war\" were integrally related. The fourteenth-century belief that the outcome of battle was determined by the gods meant that religious institutions warred both ritually and physically, and that religious attitudes frequently underpinned warrior behavior.\u00a0\nBased on diverse sources, including documents, picture scrolls, medical and religious texts, and chronicles, State of War rehabilitates warfare as a focal point of historical inquiry and provides a fascinating new overview of premodern Japanese history.",

Set in the 1970s, the novel revisits Dr. Suguro, now in late middle age, running a modest clinic in Tokyo's vibrant, seedy Shinjuku district and trying to put behind him a haunting experience from World War II. Weaving together multiple story lines, End\u00f4 lays before the reader a cross section of Tokyo in the 1970s: a vain university professor who leads a humiliating double life; a crusading young reporter determined to pursue aging war criminals; two feckless college students as empty of ideals as they are of purpose; an old man dying of cancer; a quixotic foreigner named Gaston; and Suguro. With a vision as humane as it is unflinching, Endo examines the often impossible complexities of real forgiveness in a world of inscrutable cruelty and suffering.",

            "Key Note": "Interrogates the mechanisms by which literary narrative was transformed into national discourse in early Meiji Japan.",
            "Book Description": "Novel Japan interrogates the mechanisms by which literary narrative was transformed into national discourse in early Meiji Japan. By elucidating the interplay between popular fiction and its political and economic contexts, John Mertz shows how ideas of nationhood were often the incidental result of conflicting projects of modernization and literary representation.\nTo illustrate these mechanisms, the author explores cultural phenomena such as crime trial reportage, steamboat tourism, the market for overseas fashions, peasant uprisings, images of crowds, changing expressions of social mobility, and other topics rarely brought into discussions of literary history. For instance, crime trial fiction prompted readers to consider the fate of the nation as an extension of the politics of the courtroom. Images of women were used to allegorically represent the nation itself, suffering at the hands of corrupt government, yet comprising a potent force of political righteousness.\u00a0\nIn the final chapters, Mertz examines the relations of these early Meiji works to the canon of modern Japanese literature, demonstrating the self-concealing nature of literary history, and questioning the role of the West as Japan's model for modernity.

            "Book Description": "Yoshida starts his award-winning Ozu's Anti-Cinema with a story about his trip to Ozu's deathbed. Yoshida writes that a dying Ozu whispered to him twice, as if speaking to himself, \"Cinema is drama, not accident.\" These cryptic last words troubled Yoshida for decades, and throughout this book he examines Ozu's films and tries to uncover what Ozu really meant. The book's main discussion concerns Ozu's films, but it is also Yoshida's manifesto on films and filmmaking. In other words, this book is Yoshida's personal journey into Ozu's thoughts on filmmaking and, simultaneously, into his own thoughts on the nature of cinema. Every page displays the sensibility of one artist discussing another--this is probably a book that only a filmmaker could write. Within Yoshida's luminous prose lies a finely tuned, rigorous analysis of Ozu's films, which have rarely been engaged as closely and personally as here.",

            "Book Description": "By the late Meiji period Japanese were venturing abroad in great numbers, and some of those who traveled kept diaries and wrote formal travelogues. These travelogues reflected a changing view of the West and changing artistic sensibilities in regard to the long-standing Japanese literary tradition of travel writing (kikobungaku). This book shows that overseas Meiji-period travel writers struck out to create a dynamic new type of travel literature, one that had a solid foundation in traditional Japanese kikobungaku yet also displayed influence from the West.\u00a0\nMusashino in Tuscany specifically examines the poetic imagery and allusion in these travelogues and reveals that when Japanese traveled to the West in the mid-nineteenth century, the images they wrote about tended to be associated not with places initially discovered by the Japanese traveler but with places that already existed in Western fame and lore. And unlike imagery from Japanese traveling in Japan, which was predominately nature based, Japanese overseas travel imagery was often associated with the man-made world.",

Composed simultaneously with portions of \u00d4oka's great war novel, Fires on the Plain, A Wife in Musashino recounts the story of the ill-fated love between a young demobilized soldier, Tsutomu, and his married cousin, Michiko. The impact on \u00d4oka of French writers such as Stendhal and Radiguet is apparent not only in his finely detailed observations of human emotions, but also in his trenchant critique of social customs and conventions. The novel's depiction of the motivations and circumstances of its characters and its subtle portrait of class conflict and family tensions bring the tumultuous Japanese postwar period to life, revealing with rich insight the impact of the war on Japanese society and on individual lives.",

            "Book Description": "In recent years, the impact of new media and new technologies has renewed interest in the emergence of cinema and film criticism. Yet studies to date have focused almost exclusively on Western cinema and problems of Western modernity. Shadows on the Screen offers a challenging new reevaluation of these issues. In addition to extensively annotated translations of the long-neglected film work of the celebrated Japanese writer, Tanizaki Jun'ichir\u00f4, Thomas LaMarre offers a series of commentaries with an original and sustained analysis of how Tanizaki grappled with the temporal paradoxes of non-Western modernity in his film work.\u00a0Written largely between 1917 and 1926, Tanizaki's film stories and screenplays continue to delight and disturb readers with their exploration of the racial and sexual perversion implicit in the newly cinematized modern world. Read in conjunction with his film work, Tanizaki's \u201cOrientalist\u201d essays betray their cinematic sources, revealing the profound links between traditionalism and cinematic modernism, between national identity and colonial ambivalence. Through the translation and analysis of Tanizaki's film work, Shadows on the Screen provides an invaluable historical and conceptual guide both to the emergence of cinema and film criticism in Japan and to the problem of Japanese modernity.",

            "Book Description": "Objects of Discourse analyzes the four main tenth- and eleventh-century Heian memoirs by women for their individual characteristics and what they suggest of Heian literature more broadly. The author treats the Heian women memoirists not as passive objects of men's romantic play but rather as individuals who strategically confront their difficult life situations in part by writing about their experiences. Wallace further finds in the memoirs a rich resource for understanding rhetorical and structural features of Japan's high classical period literary prose.\u00a0\nAfter taking up historical issues such as the newly developed vernacular script, pre-texts of the memoirs, and the social context of the writers, Wallace probes Gossamer Years, Lady Izumi's Story, Lady Murasaki's Journal, and The Sarashina Memoir for their stylistic aspects, rhetorical devices, Foucault's \u201cnetworks of power,\u201d and narrative structure, respectively. The result is a fascinating study of Heian women writers.",

            "Key Note": "A comprehensive study of the noh plays of Komparu Zenchiku, an actor, playwright, and theoretician of noh drama in fifteenth-century Japan.",
            "Book Description": "Revealed Identity is the first comprehensive study of the noh plays of Komparu Zenchiku, an actor, playwright, and theoretician of noh drama in fifteenth-century Japan. A renowned performer in his own time, Zenchiku was rediscovered in the modern period as the author of numerous treatises on his art, which he studied under the tutelage of his father-in-law Zeami Motokiyo (1363\u20131443). Yet Zenchiku is also a major playwright in the Japanese dramatic tradition, and his plays have only recently begun to receive the attention they deserve.\u00a0\nRevealed Identity begins with an introduction on the cultural, philosophical, and sociopolitical contexts in which fourteen fascinating plays that have been attributed to Zenchiku were produced. The plays are then grouped into five thematic clusters: the relationship between humans and the nonsentient world, transgression and the suppression or subjugation of the demonic, divinity and its intersection with landscape and the abject, the figuration of female characters as \u201cwomen who wait,\u201d and delusion and ambiguity in works based on the classic Tale of Genji.\u00a0\nThe entire study is organized around a concept called \u201crevealed identity,\u201d which is defined as a relentless nondualism coupled with a sense of drama as an opportunity to reveal the true nature of a character, rather than illustrating a transformation of that nature. In this regard, Zenchiku\u2019s attitude toward noh diverges from that of his contemporaries and challenges the classic Western view of drama that defines it in terms of conflict and action.",

Other chapters look in detail at the spiritual and cultural influences that are crucial to understanding Soseki\u2019s artistic and design sense and the development of his garden building. Finally, the book provides a detailed look at the beautiful Upper Garden at Saih\u00f4ji, built by Soseki in 1339. A Zen Life in Nature should appeal to a broad audience, including students of medieval Japanese history and religion, those interested in Zen Buddhism and Zen gardens, and people with a general interest in garden design.",

            "Book Description": "Among Japanese nostalgic for older times, as well as students and scholars of Japanese, it is commonly assumed that the Japanese language possesses special words reserved for women. Did these \u201cwomen\u2019s words\u201d actually exist at the very beginnings of the Japanese language? If such words were in fact part of the language, what kinds of attitudes and treatment toward women were inscribed in them? In her endeavor to address these questions, End\u00f4 Orie explores Japan\u2019s early literary works to discover what they have to say about the Japanese language. Among her most significant conclusions is the finding that \u201cwomanly\u201d language in Japan was socially mandated and regulated only with the beginning of warrior rule in the Kamakura period. Now, in contemporary Japan, critics charge that women\u2019s language has lost its \u201cwomanly\u201d qualities and has veered perilously close to men\u2019s language. However, if we look at the evidence of history, what we may actually be witnessing is a return to the origins of the Japanese language when no sexual distinctions were made between users.",

            "Book Description": "The victors of World War II had one idea about what freedom should be for Japan, the leftists had their notions, national patriots had theirs, and so did men and women. Yet for everyone, \u201cfreedom\u201d had some lessons to teach of its own. In 1950s Tokyo, the outlines of freedom were being tested at every level of society: by the long-suppressed socialists and communists through the labor movement, by brokers and black marketeers in the economy, by drug dealers and strip shows on the seamy side of city life, in literature by the translation of D.H. Lawrence\u2019s controversial novel Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover, in language by young people reveling in the influx of English brought by the Occupation personnel and American culture, and by retiree fanciers of festival music as an escape from the disappointments of progress.\u00a0\nUnfolding in this \u201cschool of freedom,\u201d the stories of Iosuke and Komako bring intimately to life the experience of Japanese rising out of defeat in war and exploring their manhood and womanhood in these new surroundings. Serious as its themes and landscapes are, School of Freedom is a comedy catalyzed by familiar caricatures and juxtaposed perspectives\u2014of men and women, of the elderly and the young, of old and new. With true-to-life characters, situations that vividly evoke their times, and even a happy ending, Shishi Bunroku brings a new dimension to Japanese literature in English.",

Several of his works were adapted for film and television. Recipient of the Order of Culture (1969), he is also known for his contributions to the introduction of modern, Western-style realistic theater to Japan.

            "Book Description": "Mishima on Stage presents nine remarkable plays to English readers for the first time. These plays, written between 1949 and 1962, demonstrate Mishima\u2019s breadth and originality as a playwright. Four are new kabuki plays that combine classical language and lyricism, the dance, music, and spectacle of traditional kabuki, and iconoclastic notions of class and morality that are \u201cpure Mishima.\u201d Five are shingeki plays, including the tightly written one-act Steeplechase, which fuses contemporary psychological realism with the structure of a tantric Buddhist exorcism ritual, and The Black Lizard, a campy, romping, romantic, detective mystery full of trickery and disguise.\u00a0One unifying theme shared among all the plays is the belief that deception and deceit are essential to human relationships. These character traits appear as hidden incestuous love that threatens to destroy an upper-middle class family (The Lighthouse), as weapons of choice for the powerless mistress of a business magnate (the modern noh play Yuya), or as the means to facilitate wholesome but socially forbidden romantic liaisons (two kabuki comedies). Mishima on Stage makes the genius of Japan\u2019s leading postwar playwright more accessible and apparent than ever before.",

            "Book Description": "The Bluestockings of Japan introduces English-language readers to a formative chapter in the history of Japanese feminism by presenting for the first time in English translation a collection of writings from Seit\u00f4 (Bluestockings), the famed New Women\u2019s journal of the 1910s. Launched in 1911 as a venue for women\u2019s literary expression and replete with poetry, essays, plays, and stories, Seit\u00f4 soon earned the disapproval of civic leaders, educators, and even prominent women\u2019s rights advocates. Journalists joined these leaders in ridiculing the Bluestockings as self-indulgent, literature-loving, sake-drinking, cigarette-smoking tarts who toyed with men. Yet many young women and men delighted in the Bluestockings\u2019 rebellious stance and paid serious attention to their exploration of the Woman Question, their calls for women\u2019s independence, and their debates on women\u2019s work, sexuality, and identity. Hundreds read the journal and many women felt inspired to contribute their own essays and stories. \nThe seventeen Seit\u00f4 pieces collected here represent some of the journal\u2019s most controversial writing; four of these publications provoked either a strong reprimand or an outright ban on an entire issue by government censors. All consider topics important in debates on feminism to this day such as sexual harassment, abortion, romantic love and sexuality, motherhood, and the meaning of gender equality. The Bluestockings of Japan shows that as much as these writers longed to be New Women immersed in the world of art and philosophy, they were also real women who had to negotiate careers, motherhood, romantic relationships, and an unexpected notoriety. Their stories, essays, and poetry document that journey, highlighting the diversity among these New Women and displaying the vitality of feminist thinking in Japan in the 1910s",

            "Book Description": "Furui Yoshikichi\u2019s work has long dealt with the human dramas of growing up and growing old, but by probing further into the recesses of the mind and memory, he also touches upon the deepest mysteries of human existence. And as if to balance the somber themes of madness and death, Furui shows a great sensitivity to the dark humor inherent in everyday life. White-haired Melody is no exception; it is the record of the daily experiences of a man approaching old age. It delves into the essential but hidden nature of his daily life, employing prose that is relentless in its re-creation of detail.\u00a0\nThis novel is a meditative exploration of the strange borderland around the inner experience of aging and approaching death. Yet, rather than follow a conventional plot, the novel develops by means of an intricate weaving together through time of key experiences of the narrator and his friends to build a compelling portrait of human experience. Those familiar with Furui\u2019s writings will find here a fascinating new development of earlier themes. White-haired Melody, a work by one of Japan\u2019s finest contemporary novelists writing at the height of his power, is not to be missed.",

            "Book Description": "According to a sixteenth-century Japanese commentary on the Lotus Sutra, the venerable Chins\u00f4 Kash\u00f4 was once preaching on the \u201cten wickednesses of women\u201d when an angry old nun stepped out from the audience and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s not just women who are so evil\u2014you\u2019ve got plenty of wickedness in you, too!\u201d Women were reviled in much of the popular Buddhist rhetoric of medieval Japan, castigated for their \u201cfilthy femininity,\u201d but their low spiritual status was in fact frequently contested. This dispute over the place of women in Buddhism was often played out in the realm of medieval preachers\u2019 and storytellers\u2019 apocryphal tales of the lives, deaths, and inevitable religious awakenings of prominent female literary figures of an earlier age.\u00a0Inspired by the folklorist Yanagita Kunio\u2019s groundbreaking work of the early 1930s, Preachers, Poets, Women, and the Way explores the ways in which such fictional and usually scandalous stories of the Heian women authors Izumi Shikibu, Ono no Komachi, Murasaki Shikibu, and Sei Sh\u00f4nagon were employed in the competitive preaching and fund-raising of late-Heian and medieval Japan. The book draws upon a broad range of medieval textual and pictorial sources to describe the diverse and heretofore little-studied roles of itinerant and temple-based preacher-entertainers in the formation and dissemination of medieval literary culture. By plumbing the medieval roots of Heian women poets\u2019 contemporary fame, Preachers, Poets, Women, and the Way illuminates a forgotten world of doctrinal and institutional rivalry, sectarian struggle, and passionately articulated belief, revealing the processes by which Izumi Shikibu and her peers came to be celebrated as the national cultural icons that they are today.",

            "Key Note": "Explores the daily life of the citizens of the lost periods of ancient Japan",
            "Book Description": "For centuries, scholars have wondered what daily life was like for the common people of Japan, especially for long bygone eras such as the ancient age (700\u20131150). Daily Life and Demographics in Ancient Japan attempts to solve this mystery. Using the discipline of historical demography, William Wayne Farris shows that for most of this era, Japan\u2019s overall population hardly grew at all, hovering around six million for almost five hundred years.\u00a0The reasons for the stable population were complex. Most importantly, Japan was caught up in an East Asian pandemic that killed both aristocrat and commoner in countless numbers every generation. These epidemics of smallpox, measles, mumps, and dysentery decimated the adult population, resulting in wide-ranging social and economic turmoil. Famine recurred about once every three years, leaving large proportions of the populace malnourished or dead. Ecological degradation of central Japan led to an increased incidence of drought and soil erosion. And the occasional war caused what people today refer to as \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d as soldiers murdered innocent bystanders in droves.\u00a0Under these harsh conditions, agriculture suffered from high rates of field abandonment and poor technological development. Both farming and industry shifted increasingly to labor-saving technologies. With workers at a premium, wages rose. Traders shifted from the use of money to barter. Cities disappeared. The family was an amorphous entity, with women holding high status in a labor-short economy. Broken families and an appallingly high rate of infant mortality were also part of kinship patterns. The average family lived in a cold, drafty dwelling susceptible to fire, wore clothing made of scratchy hemp, consumed meals just barely adequate in the best of times, and suffered from a lack of sanitary conditions that increased the likelihood of disease outbreak. Life was harsh for almost all people during 700\u20131150, but the suffering was not in vain, as all these experiences represented investments in human capital that would bear fruit during the medieval epoch (1150\u20131600).",

            "Book Description": "Kinugasa Teinosuke\u2019s 1926 film, A Page of Madness (Kurutta ichipeiji), is celebrated as one of the masterpieces of silent cinema. It was an independently produced, experimental, avant-garde work from Japan whose brilliant use of cinematic technique was equal to if not superior to that of contemporary European cinema. Those studying Japan, focusing on the central involvement of such writers as Yokomitsu Riichi and the Nobel Prize winner Kawabata Yasunari, have seen it as a pillar of the close relationship in the Taisho era between film and artistic modernism, as well as a marker of the uniqueness of prewar Japanese film culture.\u00a0But is this film really what it seems to be? Using meticulous research on the film\u2019s production, distribution, exhibition, and reception, as well as close analysis of the film\u2019s shooting script and shooting notes recently made available, Aaron Gerow draws a new picture of this complex work, one revealing a film divided between experiment and convention, modernism and melodrama, the image and the word, cinema and literature, conflicts that play out in the story and structure of the film and its context. These different versions of A Page of Madness were developed at the time in varying interpretations of a film fundamentally about differing perceptions and conflicting worlds, and ironically realized in the fact that the film that exists today is not the one originally released. Including a detailed analysis of the film and translations of contemporary reviews and shooting notes for scenes missing from the current print, Gerow\u2019s book offers provocative insight into the fascinating film A Page of Madness was\u2014and still is\u2014and into the struggles over this work that tried to articulate the place of cinema in Japanese society and modernity.",

            "Book Description": "The Research Guide to Japanese Film Studies provides a snapshot of all the archival and bibliographic resources available to students and scholars of Japanese cinema. Among the nations of the world, Japan has enjoyed an impressively lively print culture related to cinema. The first film books and periodicals appeared shortly after the birth of cinema, proliferating wildly in the 1910s with only the slightest pause in the dark days of World War II. The numbers of publications match the enormous scale of film production, but with the lack of support for film studies in Japan, much of it remains as uncharted territory, with few maps to negotiate the maze of material.\u00a0This book is the first all-embracing guide ever published for approaching the complex archive for Japanese cinema. It lists all the libraries and film archives in the world with significant collections of film prints, still photographs, archival records, books, and periodicals. It provides a comprehensive, annotated bibliography of the core books and magazines for the field. And it supplies hints for how to find and access materials for any research project. Above and beyond that, Nornes and Gerow\u2019s Research Guide to Japanese Film Studies constitutes a comprehensive overview of the impressive dimensions and depth of the print culture surrounding Japanese film, and a guideline for future research in the field. This is an essential book for anyone seriously thinking about Japan and its cinema.",

            "Book Description": "From 1964 until 1994 The University of Michigan Japanese Music Study Group performed annual concerts. The concerts included Edo matsuri bayashi festival music and occasional koto compositions, but the major genre was nagauta, a lyrical music originally written to accompany kabuki and classical dances. Students learned to sing in Japanese or play either the three-stringed shamisen or one of three drums of the noh drama as used in kabuki. Noh and folk flutes were also taught.\u00a0During those thirty years, the students usually translated the nagauta texts that were used for the concerts. Now, William P. Malm, the retired director of the study group, has gathered those translations into a book, An Anthology of Nagauta. Two introductory chapters provide an overview of shamisen and nagauta music; the remainder of the book contains translations of 31 nagauta compositions dating from 1753 to 1967. The translations, with commentary, appear side-by-side with the romanized text; full Japanese texts appear at the end of the book, along with a glossary and bibliography. In addition, two compact discs have been made of seven representative pieces.\u00a0In preserving these translations and presenting them to the reader, the author has provided the Japanese specialist and those interested in Japanese music a comprehensive study of nagauta.",

            "Book Description": "Television, Japan, and Globalization is a collection of essays that describe vivid and compelling examples of Japanese media and analyze them with sophisticated theoretical methods. The book makes a stunning contribution to the literature of television studies, which has increasingly recognized its problematic focus on U.S. and Western European media, and a compelling intervention in discussions of globalization, through its careful attention to contradictory and complex phenomena on Japanese TV. Case studies include talent and stars, romance, anime, telops, game/talk shows, and live action nostalgia shows. The book also looks at Japanese television from a political and economic perspective, with attention to Sky TV, production trends, and Fuji TV as an architectural presence in Tokyo. The combination of textual analysis, brilliant argument, and historical and economic context makes this book ideal for media studies audiences. Its most important contribution may be the way these essays move the study of Japanese popular culture beyond the tired truisms about postmodernism and open up new lines of thinking about television and popular culture within and between nations.",

            "Book Description": "The 1970s and 1980s saw a revolution in Japanese literary criticism. A new generation of scholars and critics, many of them veterans of 1960s political activism, arose in revolt against the largely positivistic methodologies that had hitherto dominated postwar literary studies.Creatively refashioning approaches taken from the field of linguistics, the new scholarship challenged orthodox interpretations, often introducing new methodologies in the process: structuralism, semiotics, and phenomenological linguistics, among others. The radical changes introduced then continue to reverberate today, shaping the way Japanese literature is studied both at home and abroad.\u00a0The Linguistic Turn in Contemporary Japanese Literary Studies: Politics, Language, Textuality is the first critical study of this revolution to appear in English. It includes translations of landmark essays published in the 1970s and 1980s by such influential figures as Noguchi Takehiko, Kamei Hideo, Mitani Kuniaki, and Hirata Yumi. It also collects nine new essays that reflect critically on the emergence of linguistics-based literary criticism and theory in Japan, exploring both the novel possibilities it created and the shortcomings it was unable to overcome. Scholars from a variety of disciplines and fields probe the political and intellectual implications of this transformation, as well as explore the exciting new pathways it opened up for the study of modern Japanese literature.",

            "Book Description": "Tomiyama Taeko, a Japanese visual artist born in 1921, is changing the way World War II is remembered in Japan, Asia, and the world. Her work deals with complicated moral and emotional issues of empire and war responsibility that cannot be summed up in simple slogans, which makes it compelling for more than just its considerable beauty.\u00a0Since Japan was imperialist but not Western, attention to her work also disaggregates issues that are usually bundled together, creating opportunities for both comparative and transnational analysis. Her work, discussed here and at the accompanying website http://imaginationwithoutborders.northwestern.edu/, also helps us identify the strategies that individuals use to gain critical distance from their own societies and governments and to find effective ways of expressing dissent.\u00a0Japanese today are still grappling with the effects of World War II, and, largely because of the inconsistent and ambivalent actions of the government, they are widely seen as resistant to accepting responsibility for their nation\u2019s violent actions against others during the decades of colonialism and war. Yet some individuals, such as Tomiyama, have produced nuanced and reflective commentaries on those experiences, and on the difficulty of disentangling herself from the priorities of the nation despite her lifelong political dissent. Tomiyama\u2019s sophisticated visual commentary on Japan\u2019s history\u2014and on the global history in which Asia is embedded\u2014provides a compelling guide through the difficult terrain of modern historical remembrance, in a distinctively Japanese voice.",

            "Book Description": "The Female as Subject reveals the rich and lively world of literate women in Japan from 1600 through the early twentieth century. Eleven essays by an international group of scholars from Europe, Japan, and North America examine what women of different social classes read, what books were produced specifically for women, and the genres in which women themselves chose to write. The authors explore the different types of education women obtained and the levels of literacy they achieved, and they uncover women\u2019s participation in the production of books, magazines, and speeches. The resulting depiction of women as readers and writers is also enhanced by thirty black-and-white illustrations. \nFor too long, women have been largely absent from accounts of cultural production in early modern Japan. By foregrounding women, the essays in this book enable us to rethink what we know about Japanese society during these centuries. The result is a new history of women as readers, writers, and culturally active agents. \nThe Female as Subject is essential reading for all students and teachers of Japan during the Edo and Meiji periods. It also provides valuable comparative data for scholars of the history of literacy and the book in East Asia.",

            "Book Description": "Women and Public Life in Early Meiji Japan focuses on women\u2019s activities in the new public spaces of Meiji Japan. With chapters on public, private, and missionary schools for girls, their students, and teachers, on social and political groups women created, on female employment, and on women\u2019s participation in print media, this book offers a new perspective on nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japanese history. Women\u2019s founding of and participation in conflicting discourses over the value of women in Meiji public life demonstrate that during this period active and vocal women were everywhere, that they did not meekly submit to the dictates of the government and intellectuals over what women could or should do, and that they were fully integrated in the production of Meiji culture.\nMara Patessio shows that the study of women is fundamental not only in order to understand fully the transformations of the Meiji period, but also to understand how later generations of women could successfully move the battle forward. Women and Public Life in Early Meiji Japan is essential reading for all students and teachers of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japanese history, and should also be of interest to scholars of women\u2019s history more generally.",

            "Book Description": "In this fascinating journey across centuries, Amino Yoshihiko, the premier historian of medieval Japan, invites us to rethink everything we thought we knew about Japanese history. From reconsidering the roles of outcastes and outlaws, to the provenance of \"Japan (Nihon),\" to the very meaning of writing, Amino offers a powerful critique of the conventional wisdom about Japan's past. Instead of depicting Japan as an isolated island country full of immobile peasants dominated by swaggering warriors and an unbroken line of sacred emperors, he unveils a dynamic history of an archipelago driven by the competition to control trade and movement, in which warlords and aristocrats share the main stage with pirates, courtesans, beggars, and dancing monks.\u00a0Written for a nonspecialist audience and standing on a foundation of fifty years of research in a vast and eclectic range of primary sources, Rethinking Japanese History introduces the English reader to one of Japan's most original and provocative historians. Since the 1970s, Amino has inspired readers with his view of Japanese history \"from the sea,\" in which the power politics of the samurai class were contrasted with the countervailing authorities of religious institutions, artisanal groups, and \"lords of the sea\" who enabled the movement of people and goods from the Asian continent to every harbor and village of Japan. In his portraits of an archaic and medieval past permeated with \"places of freedom\" and a grand struggle between ideologies of trade and agriculture, Amino challenged his contemporaries to reconsider not only their understanding of Japan's past, but also its present and future.\u00a0Rethinking Japanese History calls on us to contemplate seriously the meaning of the deep past in our present day. By challenging the reader to reexamine our presumptions of the past, Amino offers us a chance to reimagine the present.",

            "Book Description": "Conquering Demons examines the origins and influence of three popular anti-Kirishitan (anti-Christian) works from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These sensational fictional accounts of a near conquest of Japan by a kind of mythical Kirishitan, who used money and magic to gain converts in their attempt to take over Japan, are studied in the context of the publication trends of the time they were produced, as well as of the cultural and political attitudes toward Christianity that prevailed when they were written. The book also analyzes the representations of Japan and the Kirishitan that appear in these texts in the context of contemporary discourses on the world and Japan's place in it. New maps and information brought by the missionaries and traders to Japan reflected a world that looked very different from the traditional Sino-centric one. These anti-Kirishitan popular narratives meet the challenge of this new world by expelling it and reasserting the conventional three-realms world order, in which Japan plays an influential role. This is done most obviously in the expulsion of the Kirishitan that is narrated in the texts, but it is also achieved on another level by the representation of the Kirishitan as uncouth and very common villains.\u00a0Conquering Demons features a new look at anti-Kirishitan works from a literary perspective, examining them in the context of developments in the publishing industry and in the broader discourses on Japan and its many Others in the world. It should be of interest most broadly to scholars and teachers of Japanese history and literature, but also to those dealing with questions of identity and Othering, issues of \"mapping\" Japan and the world, and the role of manuscript culture in Edo-period literature. The translations provide an entertaining and relatively rare look at some Japanese representations of Westerners and would be useful in undergraduate classes on Japanese history, culture, and literature.",

            "Book Description": "Lords of the Sea revises our understanding of the epic political, economic, and cultural transformations of Japan's late medieval period (ca. 1300\u20131600) by shifting the conventional land-based analytical framework to one centered on the perspectives of seafarers who, though usually dismissed as \"pirates,\" thought of themselves as sea lords. Over the course of these centuries, Japan's sea lords became maritime magnates who wielded increasing amounts of political and economic authority by developing autonomous maritime domains that operated outside the auspices of state authority. They played key roles in the operation of networks linking Japan to the rest of the world, and their protection businesses, shipping organizations, and sea tenure practices spread their influence across the waves to the continent, shaping commercial and diplomatic relations with Korea and China.\u00a0Japan's land-based authorities during this time not only came to accept the autonomy of \"pirates\" but also competed to sponsor sea-lord bands who could administer littoral estates, fight sea battles, protect shipping, and carry trade. In turn, prominent sea-lord families expanded their dominion by shifting their locus of service among several patrons and by appropriating land-based rhetorics of lordship, which forced authorities to recognize them as legitimate lords over sea-based domains.\u00a0By the end of the late medieval period, the ambitions, tactics, and technologies of sea-lord mercenary bands proved integral to the naval dimensions of Japan's sixteenth-century military revolution. Sea lords translated their late medieval autonomy into positions of influence in early modern Japan and helped make control of the seas part of the ideological foundations of the state.",

Each of the case studies stands on its own as a detailed account of how a social movement has persisted against heavy odds to pursue a cause through the use of the courts.\u00a0\u00a0The studies pay particular attention to the relationship between the social movement and the lawyers who handle their cases, usually pro bono or for minimal fees. Through these case studies we learn much about how the law operates in Japan as well as how social movements mobilize and innovate to pursue their goals using legal channels. The book also provides a general introduction to the Japanese legal system and a look at how recent legal reforms are working.\u00a0\u00a0Going to Court to Change Japan will interest social scientists, lawyers, and anyone interested in the inner workings of contemporary Japan. It is suitable for use in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses on Japan in social sciences and law, and can also provide a comparative perspective to general courses in these fields.\u00a0Contributors include: John H.

            "Book Description": "The Culture of the Quake is first and foremost an exploration of Taish\u00f4-era narrative fiction. Every major film studio produced earthquake films, and authors from I-novelists to modernists, proletarian writers to popular fiction writers wrote something on the earthquake. In every case pre-existing attitudes toward their work shaped the way these people represented the earthquake, and yet the overwhelming destruction and mass suffering also posed particular challenges in representation. How could one show the pain without exploitation? Other scholars have looked at some of these groups of writers or filmmakers individually, but there are no studies looking at how they each tackled a similar subject. The Great Kanto Earthquake is an understudied event that has only recently caught the attention of scholars. By focusing on the way it was represented in high and low culture, The Culture of the Quake gives insight into how people experienced the disaster and how they interpreted it in the years following. This book should be of interest to scholars of Japanese and Asian literature, film, culture, and history, and scholars of disaster studies.",

            "Book Description": "In fall 1997 the Center for Japanese Studies at The University of Michigan celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. The November symposium featured more than fifty speakers, moderators, and musicians who celebrated the occasion and offered reminiscences on the Center's multifaceted scholarly and professional missions, discussions of the accomplishments of its al-umni/ae, and perspectives on wartime and postwar Japan-U.S. relations.\u00a0As the first American interdisciplinary institute devoted to education and research on Japan, The University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies has a path-making legacy. This volume, which includes the public presentations from the November 1997 symposium, reflects that legacy and the university's long and continuing involvement in Asia, which dates back to the 1870s.",

            "Book Description": "This bibliography of Tanizaki Jun'ichiro's work cites over 250 translations of his fiction and nearly 200 essays about his life and work, evidence that he is a writer of world renown who has a universal appeal that transcends time and place. His depictions of the exotic and erotic of Japan are popular with many foreigners, and he is a superb master of the art of storytelling.\u00a0The purpose of this volume is to provide access to those works of Tanizaki that have been translated into European languages and to facilitate further research on Tanizaki by listing relevant studies on him. The bibliography catalogs in a user-friendly way the translations of Tanizaki's works into various European languages and the scholarly and popular writings about him. A final section provides the first comprehensive list of Tanizaki's works that have been made into film. The films are arranged by year of release, and entries provide information including the director, screenplay writer, and cinematographer.\u00a0This volume challenges scholars to look beyond national, linguistic, or generic boundaries when thinking about the reception or study of Tanizaki's literature. It also forces the reader to confront in concrete terms some of the questions raised by translation and adaptation studies: questions about a text's \"afterlife,\" about \"national\" literature, about the significance of the \"original\" versus the later versions. The bibliography will be of great value to scholars and researchers interested in these issues and in Tanizaki.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Book Description": "The Tale of Saigyo is a poetic biography of the late Heian poet Saigyo (1118-90), one of the most loved and respected poets in Japanese literary history. Its anonymous author followed the venerable \"poem-tale\" tradition by using 128 of Saigyo's finest and best-known poems and weaving around them facts and legends about the poet. The result is a biographical \"journey\" through his life. Saigyo moves from the life of a brilliant and favored young poet at the Heian imperial court, through a Buddhist \"awakening\" that leads him to cast off his worldly life and family ties and to transform himself into a wandering monk in search of salvation, through the vicissitudes of his long hard life on the road, to a final apotheosis as Buddhist saint in his famous death.\u00a0While The Tale of Saigyo is on one level the story of the making of a Buddhist saint, it is also a biography of the trials and sorrows of an idealized poetic sensibility during a tempestuous time that saw the death of the Heian period, the Genpei Wars, and the beginning of the turbulent Kamakura period. The moving portrait of the wandering poet-monk that emerges through this tale crystallized the image of Saigyo and is felt in such later literary figures as Basho, who acknowledged Saigyo as his model and master.\u00a0",

Masuda succeeds in eliciting details of daily life and personal relationships that give us a wonderful picture of this courageous woman and her fighting temperament, her pride in her achievements, and her self-effacement. My Life is also a fascinating document of social history, describing the conditions of life in twentieth-century Japan as Sumii experienced it: the poverty of sharecroppers, the political movements of the 1920s, the Great Kanto Earthquake, and life on the home front during World War II. The interview was conducted in 1994, when Sumii was ninety-two years old and starting to work on volume eight of The River with No Bridge.\u00a0\u00a0",

The burakumin, who had been a lower caste in the highly stratified society of feudal Japan, were still suffering severe discrimination when Sumii's book was published in 1961. Over 8.3 million copies of the book and its sequels have been sold.

            "Book Description": "Drawn from a variety of academic disciplines and perspectives, this volume approaches ancient India both historically and geographically. The primary temporal focus lies in India's \"Early Historic\" period, from the mid-first millennium BCE through the mid-first millennium CE. The geographic focus is shifted landward rather than seaward and is centered on South Asia rather than the Mediterranean. Contributors examine power and material culture; Mediterranean image making, which looks at Greek and Roman understandings of India; and language and otherness, which explores Indian knowledge and understandings of outsiders. The volume as a whole directs us to the complex webs and networks that throughout Indian history have linked South Asians to each other and to the world beyond the subcontinent. A very wide world indeed.",

            "Book Description": "Powerful Learning is the first intellectual history of one of the great Buddhist empires of Southeast Asia, Konbaung Burma, before the British conquest. The book challenges the notion of the court and the monastic order as static institutions by examining how competition within and between them prompted major rethinking about the intellectual foundations of indigenous society and culture. The catalyst for this reformation of indigenous thought was the rise of a small clique of Buddhist monks and lay people from the frontier to commanding positions in the state and monastic order over the course of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This clique had a major influence on the creation of state myths, the ways in which the throne ruled and presented itself, and, ultimately, the relationship between the throne and the state. The new state and monastic orthodoxy, however, was challenged by other Burmese literati, who, over the course of the nineteenth century, sought in Western science, technology, and political theory other ways in which to shape Burmese perspectives on state and society. In the process, the Burmese underwent a difficult transition from premodern to modern intellectual thought, one that helped usher in British rule.Michael W. Charney is Senior Lecturer of South East Asian History at the School of Oriental and African Studies.",

            "Book Description": "The history of Thailand as a nation relies principally upon evidence from its first capital at Sukhothai. There, in the late thirteenth century, King Ram Khamhaeng devised the writing system handed down to posterity on the stone now known as Inscription No. 1. The stone was discovered by King Mongkut (Rama IV) in Sukhothai in 1833, before his ascent to the throne. \nIn recent years serious doubt has been cast upon the authenticity of Inscription No. 1, and some authorities have branded it outright as fake. One distinguished art historian has even presented evidence that the inscription is the work of King Mongkut himself. If this premise is correct, much of the history of Thailand will be open to reinterpretation.  Perhaps for that reason, and because Ram Khamhaeng is seen as a father figure in the nation he welded into the first Thai kingdom, the claim that the inscription is not genuine has been hotly disputed by more conservative voices.  The arguments and counterarguments put forward by experts from various disciplines at conferences and seminars, and in papers and articles, have been skillfully assembled in this illustrated volume. The result is an intriguing detective story, offering many clues to a historical puzzle not yet definitively solved.\n",

            "Key Note": "Through the texts included here and the different methods used in their study, this volume seeks to present an overview of modern research on Indian Mahayana Buddhist literature. ",
            "Book Description": "Indian Buddhist literature falls roughly into two classes: the religious or scriptural (sutra) and the philosophical (sastra). The three parts of this volume contain studies and translations of two sutras and one sastra. Taken together, they may permit the reader to confront the vast breadth and depth of Indian Mahayana Buddhist literature.  \nThe English translation of the first four chapters of the King of Samadhis Sutra (Samadhiraja), accompanied by a detailed introduction, is the first western language translation of the introductory chapters of the scripture, which was a central source for the philosophy of Madhyamika Buddhism. This team translation, based on the Sanskrit text of the Sutra, was conceived with a popular audience in mind. \nPart II is Gregory Schopen\u2019s edition and translation of the so-called Diamond Sutra (Vajracchedika), a famous scripture of the Perfection of Wisdom tradition. The Gilgit text presented here is one of the oldest available Sanskrit Buddhist manuscripts and as such directly reveals one aspect of sixth-century Indian Buddhism. Textual notes accompanying the edition highlight the difficulties that face the student who would study such a text. \nMasamichi Ichigo\u2019s study, edition, and translation of the Madhyamkalamkara of Santaraksita makes available one of the fundamental works of Indian Buddhist philosophy. A detailed introduction situates the thought of Santaraksita in the Madhyamika philosophical system and emphasizes his contribution not only to Indian Buddhist thought but to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition as well.\n",

Scholar Judith Becker has culled several key sources on karawitan into three volumes and has translated them for the benefit of the Western student of the gamelan tradition.\nThe texts in her collection were written over a forty-five-year time period (ca 1930-1975) and include articles by Martopangrawit, Sumarsam, Sastrapustaka, Gitosaprodjo, Sindoesawarno, Poerbapangrawit, Probohardjono, Warsadiningrat, Purbodiningrat, Poerbatjaraka, and Paku Buwana X. The final volume also contains a glossary of technical terms, an appendix of the Javanese cipher notations (titilaras kepatihan), a biographical listing, and an index to the musical pieces (Gendhing).\nJudith Becker is the Director of the Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies and Professor of Ethnomusicology, University of Michigan.",

The author also offers a perceptive treatment of the institution of kingship as a reflection of Theravada Buddhist ideals and in terms of the dictates of customary laws of succession, which resulted in the emergence of ministerial factions and princely intrigue. \nThis study is valuable both as a source of detailed information for the Southeast Asia specialist and as a textual synthesis of the broad outlines of Burmese history during the Kon-baung period.\n",

            "Key Note": "Eight essays examine South and Southeast Asian epic performance traditions of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, specifically, the relationship between performance and the written record of the epic traditions.",
            "Book Description": "By analyzing specific performance traditions, the essays address questions of what happens to written texts when they are preformed and how performance traditions are affected when they interact with written texts. The dynamics of this interaction are of particular interest in South and Southeast Asia where oral performance and written traditions share a long, interwoven history. Their continuing, complex interactions challenge earlier studies of orality and literacy, which assumed a clear distinction between the two.\nThe essays taken together also address how conceptions of the epics and their textual boundaries may differ between the two regions, where their status as ritual and religious texts varies. Perhaps now, more than ever, the boundaries of epic traditions are in a state of flux, contracting or expanding as South and Southeast Asian societies respond to increasing access to modern education, print technology, and electronic media.\n\n",

",
            "Book Description": "Dean C. Worcester first visited the Philippines as a junior member of a scientific expedition in 1887. He died there, a wealthy businessman, in 1924. One of only a handful of Americans with first-hand experience in the archipelago at the onset of the Spanish-American War, he was appointed to the First Philippine Commission, charged with the civil administration of the new American colony. He thus embarked upon a long and controversial Philippine career, embracing in time the varied roles of government official, scientist, writer, propagandist, and entrepreneur.\n In many ways Worcester typified the American colonial mission. He was talented, pragmatic, tireless, unquestioning, and ruthless in the pursuit of what he considered right. Heralded for nearly two decades as America\u2019s foremost expert on the Philippines, he was scathingly critical of Filipino society and its values, unable to comprehend the validity of a culture that did not conform to an American ideal. Described by more than one of his countrymen as an \u201cexemplar\u201d of Americanism, a colonial statesman making \u201clasting contributions to mankind,\u201d from the Filipino perspective he represented merely the \u201cimmovable column\u201d of a \u201chypocritical foreign administration.\u201d\n",

            "Book Description": "From the perspective of a District Officer and later Deputy Commissioner in rural Burma, Singh details both the changes and continuities in local administration which accompanied independence. This period of violent maneuvering between the Communists, Karen, Chin, Kachin, People\u2019s Volunteer Organizations, and army and local police units brought Burma to the verge of fragmentation. When the town of Yamethin was cut off from government support in 1949, Singh cleverly used his ties within the community to unite the people. Altogether, the memoir documents how personal relationships and loyalties between individuals were frequently key factors affecting the local balance of power.  This graphic and lively eye-witness account reveals how the major political events discussed in standard histories actually unfolded away from the centers of power.",

Gedney began his exhaustive study of it in the 1960s. Never before published, Gedney\u2019s field data on Saek are collected here, including a 550-page glossary and 450 pages of Saek oral literature presented in free translation and linear glosses. The volume concludes with two important, previously unpublished Gedney papers, \u201cSaek Final-L: Archaism or Innovation?\u201d and \u201cThe Twelve Year Names in Saek.\u201d\nWhile William J. Gedney\u2019s \u201cThe Saek Language\u201d offers a particularly rich vein of primary data to specialists in comparative Tai, its texts\u2014ranging from oral histories and descriptions of Saek life to folktales\u2014are also of value to historians, anthropologists, and folklorists. Introductions contextualize the linguistic data for more general readers.\n",

Gedney first began his intensive and meticulous study of the Tai language family, concentrating primarily upon the Southwestern Branch of the family. Working in Thailand, Laos, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, he recorded word lists, folktales, stories, and songs. From this early work come the data in this volume, including White Tai, Red Tai, Black Tai, Tai Nuea, Hsi Paw Shan, Chinese Shan, Khuen, and Yong. As with the others in this series, this volume will be of interest to linguists, folklorists, and anthropologists.",

These endeavors have resulted in numerous scholarly papers and seven lengthy volumes devoted to Tai languages and dialects.  Models of clarity and precision, Gedney\u2019s studies have helped to establish the field of historical comparative Tai studies.  What is not so well known is his contribution to folklore, translation, and literature. This volume, William J. Gedney\u2019s Thai and Indic Literary Studies, remedies that situation. In this volume, Gedney discusses Thai Riddles, problems in translating Thai poetry, and historical development and Sanskrit influences in Thai verse forms. The papers in this volume with their insights and new interpretations will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of Thai literature and its history. ",

It aims at teaching Sanskrit as a language, rather than as a religious or mystical entity. It also simplifies the process of learning Sanskrit by dissociating this language-learning process from the heavy burdens imposed both by the tradition of Indo-European linguistics and the tradition of indigenous Sanskrit grammarians in India. By treating Sanskrit as a productive language, rather than as a dead language merely to be deciphered, the book represents a significant advance over the traditional Western approach to the study of Sanskrit.\nWork on this book began in 1976, and now almost two generations of Professor Deshpande's students have used successively improved versions. The book's examples include many modified versions of classical Sanskrit passages from epic texts such as The Mahabharata and The Ramayana. The book also contains examples from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions, as well as samples of Sanskrit poetry and satire.",

            "Book Description": "K. C. Das is deservedly one of the most celebrated writers in India today. He writes primarily in Oriya, the language of his native state of Orissa, where he was born in 1924. A civil servant by profession, Das pursued a second career as a writer of stories, poems, and essays.\nThe stories in this collection take place in an urban setting. The characters are mainly middle class, making them more accessible to North American readers than other examples of contemporary Indian fiction. These are not simple stories. They are about \"divides,\" about gaps between realities and imagination. In complex shifts between direct dialogue, interior monologue, and interior or imagined dialogue, Das lovingly but mercilessly exposes his characters' thoughts, self-deceptions, and the games they play with each other. These are stories about human weaknesses, the fallibility of human relationships, and the strategies we adopt to cope with our failures. They are about coming to terms with unpleasant, sometimes shocking truths about ourselves and others.\nPhyllis Granoff teaches in the Department of Religious Studies, McMaster University. She edits the Journal of Indian Philosophy and has published a translation of Jain stories.",

            "Key Note": "Through the texts included here and the different methods used in their study, this volume seeks to present an overview of modern research on Indian Mahayana Buddhist literature. \n",
            "Book Description": "Indian Buddhist literature falls roughly into two classes: the religious or scriptural (sutra) and the philosophical (sastra). The three parts of this volume contain studies and translations of two sutras and one sastra. Taken together, they may permit the reader to confront the vast breadth and depth of Indian Mahayana Buddhist literature.  \nThe English translation of the first four chapters of the King of Samadhis Sutra (Samadhiraja), accompanied by a detailed introduction, is the first western language translation of the introductory chapters of the scripture, which was a central source for the philosophy of Madhyamika Buddhism. This team translation, based on the Sanskrit text of the Sutra, was conceived with a popular audience in mind. \nPart II is Gregory Schopen\u2019s edition and translation of the so-called Diamond Sutra (Vajracchedika), a famous scripture of the Perfection of Wisdom tradition. The Gilgit text presented here is one of the oldest available Sanskrit Buddhist manuscripts and as such directly reveals one aspect of sixth-century Indian Buddhism. Textual notes accompanying the edition highlight the difficulties that face the student who would study such a text. \nMasamichi Ichigo\u2019s study, edition, and translation of the Madhyamkalamkara of Santaraksita makes available one of the fundamental works of Indian Buddhist philosophy. A detailed introduction situates the thought of Santaraksita in the Madhyamika philosophical system and emphasizes his contribution not only to Indian Buddhist thought but to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition as well.\n",
