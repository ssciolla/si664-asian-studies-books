To the historian of political institutions it provides a case-study of the workings of a specific branch of the imperial Chinese administration from the highest to the lowest levels over a period of three hundred years. To the economic historian it offers a mine of information on the nature and scale of Chinese and waterway transportation, both as regards the techniques of transport and the flow of goods. To the comparativist seeking insight into the reasons for China\'s failure to expand overseas in the manner of early modern Europe it gives a new perspective on the withdrawal of the Ming government from the sea: the perfection of inland waterway transport made it necessary to maintain a strong naval capacity to provide and protect the shipping that carried northwards the Court\'s supplies of grain. To the military historian it reveals something of the foundations of that extraordinary logistical capability that helped to keep the Chinese empire together and to prevent the fragmentation and erosion that befell Western Europe and Byzantium respectively. Such, however, is the careful objectivity of the work that, for the most part, the reader is left to ask his own questions and draw his own conclusions.

For the first time it is possible to be relatively confident, as the result of the author\'s systematic exploitation of an enormous range of source materials, about the parts played by transport, trade, business organization and urbanization in this revolution. It is hardly necessary to labor the significance of the advance. China\'s was beyond any reasonable doubt the most developed economy in the medieval world, and the investigation both of the causes that made this possible and of those that subsequently prevented a take-off into sustained growth is among the most pressing tasks waiting to be accomplished before any general theory of economic development, solidly grounded in comparative historical analysis, becomes possible.

In the same period, not fully known to their colleagues elsewhere, Japanese historians have also produced a considerable number of studies on the same subject.

By the early nineteenth century there were almost 25,000 of them, and pawnbroking yielded a higher rate of return on investment than did land. The Ch\'ing also saw this industry in decline, its exponential growth a victim of the Taiping Rebellion and rapidly developing Shansi banks. Yet, in republican times the pawnshop was still common in city and countryside alike. Furthermore, it was to live on after Liberation. But when the People\'s Bank of China opened Citizens\' Petty Loan Offices in the early 1950s in order to furnish workers and peasant with low-interest loans, and when the transformation of private enterprise occurred in 1956, the last of the pawnbrokers, holding out in urban areas such as Shanghai, were forced to close their doors, and the pawnshop ceased to exist on the mainland. Its life had spanned almost fifteen hundred years. On Taiwan, however, the institution survives—there were 750 pawnshops on the island in 1974—as it does in most overseas Chinese communities.

These three painters, each important in his own time and deemed a master by later critics, were all concerned with the subjective in the objective world. In Chinese painting there is no clear desire to separate these two realms; rather, there is a constant, conscious play between the physical reality of the world and the subjective vision of the artist. The artist is continually imitating the world—sometimes more, sometimes less—but he never denies its appearance to the point of total abstraction; nor, in the other extreme, does he claim for the physical world an existence independent of his own involvement.</p>',160,2,1,3),(9,'Concept of Man in Contemporary China','The',NULL,'The Concept of Man in Contemporary China','Considers the connections between politics, education, and distinctly Chinese theories of mind','<p class=\"Bkdesc\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The Concept of Man in Contemporary China</i> claims that the most striking political theories and policies of the contemporary period rest on distinctly Chinese theories of mind.

Natural equality, or the descriptive sense of equality, refers to common attributes or characteristics shared by all persons at birth. This feature of Chinese views of human beings is different from the evaluative sense of equality in mainstream Western theories. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">To develop his thesis, Munro comprehensively investigates historical documents, books, philosophical texts of various schools, and bone and bronze inscriptions. Based as it is on such a wide array of sources, the thesis of natural equality has been broadly accepted by scholars and philosophers in the West and in China. Impressively, Munro identified the single theoretical position common to all philosophical schools of the Warring States era, despite their intense disputation about the issues of the day.

Specifically, how much consultation occurs during the drafting of major Politburo documents, and who is brought into this process? How is information channeled up to this body, and what are the rules that govern the access of the Politburo members themselves to data generated by the bureaucracies? How are the political strategies of individual leaders and political factions attuned to this system of information channeling? What types of decisions are reached by the Politburo? To whom are they communicated? How rigidly must they be followed? How institutionalized is this entire decision making system, and has it become more—or less—institutionalized over the years?

For several generations, noncommunists and communists in China have excoriated individualism as the equivalent of selfishness. For them it is a morally insupportable value, not least because it is thought to fragment societies.

This book explores Mao\'s gradual development of a new style of politics and social organization over three decades of power-conflict, followed by the struggle to institutionalize his concepts in post-Liberation China.</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">Most previous studies of China\'s efforts to enter the modern world have focused on the revolution of the country\'s historical institutions, on the ferment of new ideas and social values in a society which for thousands of years has had a highly developed intellectual tradition, and on the efforts to transform a peasant society into an industrializing nation-state. Here we explore a different aspect of the story. It is our basic assumption that China\'s difficulties in responding to the changing world of the past century have been largely cultural and psychological in quality rather than institutional or economic. Mao Tse-tung began his political career in the period of cultural challenge of the late 1910s and early 1920s known as the \"May Fourth\" era. He is concluding his career with a \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,\" an astounding effort which began in the mid-1960s to confront once again what he and his Red Guard supporters called China\'s \"four olds\"—her traditional customs, habits, culture, and social thought. </p> <p class=\"Toreview\">Thus there is an important tension between Mao Tse-tung\'s personal conception of how China\'s political and social life should be organized in the country\'s search for new greatness, and the endurance of old social attitudes and political habits of millions of Chinese who embody the legacy of China\'s past.

This was the greatest population movement in modern Chinese history and ranks among the largest migrations in the world. This book is the first comprehensive study of that migration. Drawing on the disciplines of the coauthors, the book focuses on both the broad quantitative outlines of the movement and on the decisions and experiences of individual migrants and their families.

She goes on to explore how the play has been changed in later adaptations, up to its most recent productions by Peter Sellars and Chen Shi-Zheng in the United States and Europe.

Sweeten pieces together a close view of tensions in the countryside, their eruption into violence, and as often, their peaceful resolution. He concludes that the sources of tension lay with day-to-day problems common throughout rural China, rather than with issues of religion per se. Although religious identity did play a role in local conflict during this forty-year period, personal or family disputes, poverty, and general alienation turn out to be equally important factors.</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">Earlier scholarship on urban anti-Christian incidents pointed to agitation by local elites against aggressive missionaries and the enclaving of Chinese Christians apart from their communities, yet this author\'s findings suggest that Catholics in rural Jiangxi were normally well integrated into their larger communities, and conflict with Catholics was more often a contest of personal interests among neighbors.</p>',296,91,1,6),(111,'Screening China',NULL,'Critical Interventions, Cinematic Reconfigurations, and the Transnational Imaginary in Contemporary Chinese Cinema','Screening China: Critical Interventions, Cinematic Reconfigurations, and the Transnational Imaginary in Contemporary Chinese Cinema','<p class=\"Keynote\">The most comprehensive book to date on the relevant issues in Chinese film studies</p>','<p class=\"Toreview\">Yingjin Zhang guides the reader through the development of Chinese film criticism, pointing out that Western critics have studied a comparatively small number of films from a much larger body of work, often with a unidirectional Eurocentric bias.

Prints of this type are known today as \"New Year pictures\" because the demand for them peaked at New Year\'s time. However, the term \"popular print\" more accurately describes these works, whose subjects include deities and tutelary spirits, illustrations to stories and operas, and even contemporary political or revolutionary messages.</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">The emphasis on the artistic aspects of these prints makes this publication uniquely appealing to Chinese art historians but also to those interested in Chinese anthropology, popular religion, Chinese and other folk art, and traditional crafts.</p>',216,94,1,6),(114,'Shih-shuo Hsin-yü',NULL,'A New Account of Tales of the World','Shih-shuo Hsin-yü: A New Account of Tales of the World','<p class=\"Keynote\">A collection of anecdotes, conversations, and remarks concerning historic personalities of 150 to 420 A.D.

The continued vitality of intergenerational support and filial obligations in these samples is not simply an instance of strong Confucian tradition trumping powerful forces of change. Instead, and somewhat paradoxically, the continued strength of filial obligations can be attributed largely to the institutions of Chinese socialism forged in the era of Mao Zedong. With socialist institutions now under assault in the People\'s Republic of China, the future of intergenerational relations in the twenty-first century is once again uncertain.</p>',350,96,1,6),(116,'Defining Modernity',NULL,'Guomindang Rhetorics of a New China, 1920–1970','Defining Modernity: Guomindang Rhetorics of a New China, 1920–1970','<p class=\"Keynote\">Employs a close analysis of cultural, ideational, and symbolic practices in a reappraisal of Guomindang history</p>','<p class=\"Toreview\">Over the course of the twentieth century, the Guomindang (the KMT or Nationalists) articulated and marketed symbols, traits, and institutions crucial to a modernizing China.

Salt, with its highly localized and large-scale production, was an ideal target for bureaucratic management.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">In the Song dynasty (960–1279), fiscal pressures on the government had intensified with increased centralization and bureaucratization. A bloated administration and an enormous standing army maintained against incursions by aggressive steppe neighbors placed tremendous strain on Song finances. Developing the salt monopoly seemed a logical and indeed urgent strategy, but each actor in this plan—the emperor, local officials, monopoly administrators, producers, merchants, and consumers—had his own interests to protect and advance. Thus attempts to maximize the effectiveness of the monopoly meant frequent policy swings and led to levels of corruption that would ultimately undo the Song.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Unlike other contemporary sources, the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Songshi</i> treatise organizes its subject into an intelligible and detailed narrative, elucidating special terminology, the bureaucracy and its processes, and debates relating to Chinese finance and politics, as well as the salt industry itself.

In place of the episodic tale of fantastic adventures so popular with nineteenth-century Japanese readers, Futabatei presented a story with the simplest plot. The whole novel hinges on the fact that the hero, Utsumi Bunzo, has lost his post in the lowest ranks of the government bureaucracy. As a consequence, he finds that his marriage to his cousin, Osei, which had been virtually assured, has now become impossible. Osei\'s affections soon turn to Bunzo\'s former college, the up-and-coming Honda Noboru. Futabatei tells his entire story within the confines of this plot. There are only four main characters—Bunzo, Noboru, Osei, and Osei\'s mother, Omasa—and a few minor characters. It was Futabatei\'s intention to picture the nature of his society through these characters; to demonstrate by means of the words and actions of his characters the effect of Meiji life on Japanese society.</p>',396,1,2,4),(133,'Grass on the Wayside (Michikusa)',NULL,'A Novel','Grass on the Wayside (Michikusa): A Novel','<p class=\"Keynote\">A translation of Natsume Soseki\'s only autobiographical novel \"Grass on the Wayside\"</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">Soseki was a sick man when he wrote Grass on the Wayside. After 1910, when he very nearly died from stomach ulcers, he seems to have felt that death was not far away. He wrote the novel in 1915, when he was forty-eight; the following year, before he could complete Light and Darkness (Meian), he died. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The period dealt with in Grass on the Wayside is very short. It begins soon after the author\'s return from London in 1903 and ends as his career as a writer is about to begin. (I am a Cat was published in 1905). Kenzo (the name Soseki gives himself) is at this time in his middle thirties, and his wife in her middle twenties. It was then, presumably, that relations between Soseki and his wife became strained and he began to be acutely conscious of his loneliness. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The novel has its shortcomings. It is not devoid of self-pity or naïveté, and it is so introspective that the reader may find it at times rather slow-moving. Nevertheless, it is all in his most serious work.

Nagai Kafu may be considered such an author. Therefore, this book is an introduction to the man and his city, accompanied by a fairly generous sampling from his works.

Leaving aside for the moment the precise meaning of the term rekishi monogatari, we can say that it refers to a type of history (rekishi), and that there is much in the content of The Great Mirror to support the classification. The book can be viewed as an account of the rise of an aristocratic family, the Fujiwara, from its seventh-century inception to its zenith in the career of its most conspicuously successful member, Michinaga (966-1027), who dominated the Court from 995 until his death, acting for many years as principal minister, and wielding de facto power, through martial and family connections, as the father-in-law of three Emperors, one Crown Prince, and one Retired Emperor; the grandfather of an Emperor and a Crown Prince; and the father of a Regent.

The lovers, unable to extricate themselves from their family and professional obligations so that they may marry, escape the unsympathetic world by seeking death in a double suicide. The plot as a whole is well integrated, and the details of the story are unfolded in a natural manner. Unexpected complications in the course of events hold the reader\'s attention; variety of action sustains the pace. The flow of events seems logical, and the main characters have a tragic quality.

First, and obviously, it will help the reader gain a deeper understanding of Japanese literature and art. By learning about the philosophies of art in Japan, they will come to know the aims and methods with which the Japanese produced paintings, music, plays, novels and poems. As it happens, many of the major Japanese aestheticians were also great artists, so the person who carefully examines their theories of art will be rewarded with a glimpse into the secret of their creative achievements too. In this respect it is rather strange that Japanese aesthetics still remains a neglected subject in the West, where there is an increasing interesting Japanese art. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Secondly, an examination of Japanese aesthetic ideas will contribute towards an international definition of art. Since ancient times numerous attempts have been made to answer the questions \"What is art?\" or \"What is literature?\"; yet in almost every case the answer has been formulated within a single cultural tradition. A definition of art that makes any claim to universality must be applicable to all arts, Oriental or Western. Japanese theories of art, which developed independently of Western culture, may provide a convenient touchstone by which to test the universal validity of a Western aesthetic concept.

Japan is today a modern nation in the full sense of the term. Yet its history is less familiar to us than the histories of those Western powers that it has now outstripped, or of the other countries of Asia that have gained recognition as the birthplaces of ancient civilizations or world religions.

But (even if children slept regularly ten hours a day) that still leaves some 65,000 waking hours between the ages of two and sixteen which they will spend with family and neighborhood children. And those hours are immensely important-- not perhaps for learning the facts of geography and history or even the rules of addition and subtractions-- but for learning the more important things-- learning to describe and summarize, caring for accuracy and order; to abstract and generalize, proceeding from particulars of seed-corn and gold bangles to the general categories of investment and insurance; to hold future possibilities in mind and compare them with those of the present, assessing the possibilities of jam tomorrow against visible access to jam today; to string a series of \'if x then y\' propositions together to relate means to ends, working out how much fertilizer to use to get the best harvest or how worthwhile it would be to accept the constraints of a cooperative; to emphasize, to imagine, what it would be like to be someone else and how that someone else might react to what you\'re proposing to do-- for learning, in short, to react to the environment with calculation, rules and principles, not just with immediate unrestrained impulse.

The unknown compiler was interested less in exploring psychological subtleties than in presenting vivid portraits of human foibles and eccentricities. The stories in the present selection have been chosen to provide an idea of the scope and structure of the book as a whole, and also for their appeal to the modern reader.

One to show the importance to Japan of the international order which militarists had done so much to destroy, and which would have to be recreated in its essentials if it were again to prosper.

Here in the works of such talented authors as Enchi Fumiko, Kōno Taeko, Kurahashi Yumiko, and others—many of whom are translated into English for the first time—we find stories about Japanese women as single mothers, as disillusioned and doubting lovers, as women questioning their marriages and their lives.

Although the role of \"good wife and wise mother\" may persist as an ideal, the stories in this anthology show that Japanese women have as many conflicting emotions, frustrations, and questions-- and as much anger-- as women in other countries who are trying to adapt to new freedoms and understand what it means to be female.

Historians have ignored the settled conditions of most samurai and instead concentrated on the study of the minority of activist samurai leaders who, with the backing of only a few Han (feudal domains) sought to overthrow the old order and whose success in doing so has made the study of the modernization of Japan the prime concern of historians. The history of the Meiji period may have been an overall political and industrial success story, but for a fuller understanding of the conditions of that success it is also necessary to understand \"what it was really like\" for the members of the old elite to be estranged from the proponents of revolution and what many members did to assure their own social and psychological position in a world they had not expected.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">In this book the author attempts to show that the impact of the Meiji Restoration destroyed the meaningfulness of the Confucian doctrine for these declasse samurai. Through Christianity, the samurai attempted to revive their status in society by finding a doctrine that offered a meaningful path to power. But in doing so, they had to accept a new theory of social relations.

The anthology is, without doubt, the most popular and widely known collection of poetry in Japan - a distinction it has maintained for hundreds of years.

It began in 1193 with a politically unimportant assassination, but the murder so captured the imagination of the Japanese that, by the fourteenth century, wandering minstrels throughout the nation were reciting highly embellished oral tales of the vendetta. The most dramatic versions of the Soga story were created for the stage—Noh, kowakamai, puppet theater, and Kabuki. Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Japan\'s greatest playwright revitalized the tradition in his thirteen Soga plays (1683-1718), and by the mid-eighteenth century the Soga story had become the most popular subject for Kabuki plays in Edo, plays that linked religious rituals and secular entertainment in new ways. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Avatars of Vengeance</i> explores the timeless appeal that the Soga story has exerted on the Japanese and describes the processes that took the brothers through successive incarnations in literature. Beginning as loyal samurai, they changed into Shinto gods, then exemplars of filial virtue, suave dandies, superhuman swashbucklers, sensitive lovers, and back into gods again. The heroines of the story also underwent changes, from exemplars of religious devotion in the medieval, oral tale to icons of romantic love and models of secular virtue in later versions. The most startling transformations in the Soga story and its characters took place on stage as theater changed and developed, fueled by the tastes of succeeding generations of audiences and new methods of stage presentation, by advances in performers\' training and technique, and by changing religious attitudes toward the Soga deities. Kominz explains why plays about the Soga revenge so often marked new directions in dramaturgy and play writing. His study demonstrates that no dramatic theme better illuminates the dynamics of creativity in traditional Japanese theater than the Soga vendetta.</p>',296,13,2,5),(171,'Wild Goose','The',NULL,'The Wild Goose','<p class=\"Keynote\">A turn-of-the-century novel from one of the giants of modern Japanese literature</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">Mori Ōgai (1862-1922), one of the giants of modern Japanese literature, wrote <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The Wild Goose</i> at the turn of the century.

Their marriage ended in divorce, and one of the author\'s intentions seems to have been to write an anti-romance, one that could be subtitled, \"I married the prince but we did not live happily ever after.\" Yet, particularly in the first part of the diary, Michitsuna\'s Mother is drawn to record those events and moments when the marriage did live up to a romantic ideal fostered by the Japanese tradition of love poetry. At the same time, she also seems to seek the freedom to live and write outside the romance myth and without a husband.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Since the author was by inclination and talent a poet and lived in a time when poetry was a part of everyday social intercourse, her account of her life is shaped by a lyrical consciousness. The poems she records are crystalline moments of awareness that vividly recall the past.

It also pays careful attention to the poems of the text, rendering as much as possible their complex imagery and open-ended quality.

Yet many young women and men delighted in the Bluestockings\' rebellious stance and paid serious attention to their exploration of the Woman Question, their calls for women\'s independence, and their debates on women\'s work, sexuality, and identity. Hundreds read the journal and many women felt inspired to contribute their own essays and stories. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The seventeen <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Seitō</i> pieces collected here represent some of the journal\'s most controversial writing; four of these publications provoked either a strong reprimand or an outright ban on an entire issue by government censors.

This dispute over the place of women in Buddhism was often played out in the realm of medieval preachers\' and storytellers\' apocryphal tales of the lives, deaths, and inevitable religious awakenings of prominent female literary figures of an earlier age.

Using the discipline of historical demography, William Wayne Farris shows that for most of this era, Japan\'s overall population hardly grew at all, hovering around six million for almost five hundred years. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The reasons for the stable population were complex. Most importantly, Japan was caught up in an East Asian pandemic that killed both aristocrat and commoner in countless numbers every generation. These epidemics of smallpox, measles, mumps, and dysentery decimated the adult population, resulting in wide-ranging social and economic turmoil. Famine recurred about once every three years, leaving large proportions of the populace malnourished or dead. Ecological degradation of central Japan led to an increased incidence of drought and soil erosion. And war led soldiers to murder innocent bystanders in droves. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Under these harsh conditions, agriculture suffered from high rates of field abandonment and poor technological development. Both farming and industry shifted increasingly to labor-saving technologies. With workers at a premium, wages rose. Traders shifted from the use of money to barter. Cities disappeared. The family was an amorphous entity, with women holding high status in a labor-short economy. Broken families and an appallingly high rate of infant mortality were also part of kinship patterns. The average family lived in a cold, drafty dwelling susceptible to fire, wore clothing made of scratchy hemp, consumed meals just barely adequate in the best of times, and suffered from a lack of sanitary conditions that increased the likelihood of disease outbreak. While life was harsh for almost all people from 700 to 1150, these experiences represented investments in human capital that would bear fruit during the medieval epoch (1150–1600).</p>',148,63,2,5),(221,'Page of Madness','A','Cinema and Modernity in 1920s Japan','A Page of Madness: Cinema and Modernity in 1920s Japan','<p class=\"Keynote\">Offers provocative insight into a masterpiece of silent cinema using a newly released original script and notes</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">Kinugasa Teinosuke\'s 1926 film <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">A Page of Madness</i> (<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Kurutta ichipeiji</i>) is celebrated as one of the masterpieces of silent cinema.

Those studying Japan, focusing on the central involvement of such writers as Yokomitsu Riichi and the Nobel Prize winner Kawabata Yasunari, have seen it as a pillar of the close relationship in the Taisho era between film and artistic modernism, as well as a marker of the uniqueness of prewar Japanese film culture. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">But is this film really what it seems to be?

Creatively refashioning approaches taken from the field of linguistics, the new scholarship challenged orthodox interpretations, often introducing new methodologies in the process: structuralism, semiotics, and phenomenological linguistics, among others.

Instead of depicting Japan as an isolated island country full of immobile peasants dominated by swaggering warriors and an unbroken line of sacred emperors, he unveils a dynamic history of an archipelago driven by the competition to control trade and movement, in which warlords and aristocrats share the main stage with pirates, courtesans, beggars, and dancing monks. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Written for a nonspecialist audience and standing on a foundation of fifty years of research in a vast and eclectic range of primary sources, Rethinking Japanese History introduces the English reader to one of Japan\'s most original and provocative historians. Since the 1970s, Amino has inspired readers with his view of Japanese history \"from the sea,\" in which the power politics of the samurai class were contrasted with the countervailing authorities of religious institutions, artisanal groups, and \"lords of the sea\" who enabled the movement of people and goods from the Asian continent to every harbor and village of Japan. In his portraits of an archaic and medieval past permeated with \"places of freedom\" and a grand struggle between ideologies of trade and agriculture, Amino challenged his contemporaries to reconsider not only their understanding of Japan\'s past, but also its present and future.

New maps and information brought by the missionaries and traders to Japan reflected a world that looked very different from the traditional Sino-centric one. These anti-Kirishitan popular narratives meet the challenge of this new world by expelling it and reasserting the conventional three-realms world order, in which Japan plays an influential role.

They played key roles in the operation of networks linking Japan to the rest of the world, and their protection businesses, shipping organizations, and sea tenure practices spread their influence across the waves to the continent, shaping commercial and diplomatic relations with Korea and China. Japan\'s land-based authorities during this time not only came to accept the autonomy of \"pirates\" but also competed to sponsor sea-lord bands who could administer littoral estates, fight sea battles, protect shipping, and carry trade. In turn, prominent sea-lord families expanded their dominion by shifting their locus of service among several patrons and by appropriating land-based rhetorics of lordship, which forced authorities to recognize them as legitimate lords over sea-based domains. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">By the end of the late medieval period, the ambitions, tactics, and technologies of sea-lord mercenary bands proved integral to the naval dimensions of Japan\'s sixteenth-century military revolution.

Furthermore, the current economic friction has the potential to adversely affect future political relationships. Indeed, under conditions of economic stagnation, major economic issues inevitably become political issues.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">With these considerations in mind, the Joint U.S.–Japan Automotive Study project was started in September 1981 to determine the conditions that will allow for the prosperous coexistence of the respective automobile industries. During this two-year study, we have identified four driving forces that will play a major role in determining the future course of the automotive industry of both countries. These are: (1) consumers\' demands and aspirations vis-à-vis automobiles; (2) flexible manufacturing systems (FMS); (3) rapidly evolving technology; and (4) the internationalization of the automotive industry.

This volume constitutes a step toward bringing to the English reader some sense of the norms, beliefs, styles, and modes of exercising power of Japanese political leaders and the organizational and political contexts which are changing leadership role expectations. The second volume in this series concentrates more explicitly on leadership recruitment, although the subject is also addressed here.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">All of the essays in this volume highlight specific politicians, while attempting to develop analytic categories to understand the broader significance of these types of leaders. Included are the following: a Liberal Democratic Party prime minister and faction leader (Fukuda Takeo) who rose \"almost effortlessly\" to the pinnacle of power on the basis of an elitist educational and bureaucratic career background and another (Tanaka Kakuei) who took advantage of the chaotic wartime and immediate postwar period to overcome the limitations of his commoner background by developing an entrepreneurial style that makes him even today \"the most powerful in Japan\"; a younger conservative leader (Kono Yohei) who, with certain others of his generation, found life within the restrictive but predictable career paths of ruling Liberal Democrats less attractive than the risky option of forming his own New Liberal Club; an unconventional Socialist chairman (Asukata Ichio) who bucks the pull toward coalition making among the opposition parties in favor of his belief that this major but perpetual opposition party must first reconstruct itself and structure a new popular consensus that can legitimize a coalitional alternative to the Liberal Democrats; parliamentary leaders (like lower-house speaker Maeo Shigesaburo, directors of the House Management Committee, and heads of the Diet policy committees of the various parties) who are projected into increasingly influential roles by changing electoral trends and popular expectations; an innovative and dynamic mayor (Suzuki Heizaburo) who, taking advantage of the considerable authority afforded by Japan\'s \"presidential\" system of local chief executives, pursues his own priorities, mobilizing the requisite support despite the lack of national guidance and the oppositions of former backers; and the \"power behind the throne\" (Matsunaga Yasuzaemon and Komori Takeshi) whose visions move prime ministers and governors as well as their own followers in powerful public and private bureaucracies.

It is quite amenable to cross-national comparison, as much excellent research in Europe indicates. Voting research has also been popular among specialists of Japanese politics.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Japan shares its level of economic development and many institutional structures with Western countries, but the cultural setting-- presumably including political culture-- is distinctive. It thus offers a splendid testing ground for broadening culture-bound theories of political behavior, as well as providing some fascinating puzzles of its own.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The essays collected in this volume deal with several theories and several puzzles. John Strate draws ingeniously on Japanese (and Italian) survey data to construct a fundamental critique of the concept of party identification, that most basic component of American-style research on the voting decision. His paper suggests a new linkage between social change and shifts in party support. Soo Young Auh deals with political participation, another well explored body of theory, but he treats levels of participation as an independent variable which helps explain variations in opinions on issues (including the security treaty and constitutional revision) among party adherents. Tom Rochon\'s crisp paper finally answers the old question of why Japanese tend to vote \"for the man\" rather than on the basis of party or issue orientation: it is not the personalistic culture, it is the electoral system. All three authors have relied mainly on secondary analysis of the large election survey carried out in 1967 by Robert E. Ward and Akira Kubota.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The other three papers focus on candidates and elections. Jung-Suk Youn has collected an impressive amount of data on those who ran for the Lower House of the Diet in the postwar period. His analysis of recruitment patterns emphasizes differences between parties and over time. Minoru Yanagihashi conducted his own survey of local and national candidates in Hyogo Prefecture to see how their perceptions of the of various electoral factors vary by party and level. His study throws new light on the role of the yuryuokusha, the \"men of influence\" often seen as dominating election campaigns. Finally, Steven Reed has looked closely at aggregate election data along with case-study evidence to assess the importance of the \"incumbency effect,\" the \"second-term barrier\" and the progressive local government movement on who comes to power in Japanese prefectures.

The national importance of the issues seemed only matched by the superficiality of the analyses being offered. The tendency to think in terms of scapegoats was particularly evident. The Japanese as the basic cause of our problems has been a particularly notable theme. To be sure, cooperation with the Japanese in formulating a rational overall trade policy may be an important part of the solution. It has also been fashionable to blame it all on American auto industry management for not concentrating on the production of small cars when \"everyone knew\" that was the thing to do. Alternatively, government meddling was blamed for all our problems. Clearly, the complex problem we faced required more penetrating analyses. It seemed therefore, that the time was ripe for a public seminar which moved beyond the rhetoric of the moment and probed some of the deeper causes of our problems and possible directions for future policy.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">In holding the January 1981 auto conference, the Center took it as their task to begin addressing the critical issues facing the industry, with particular, but not exclusive, attention to examining the role of the Japanese auto industry. They had in mind not to simply conduct a rational discussion of the trade issue but to probe the sources of Japanese competitive strength, especially those features whose study might profit them. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">In these proceedings, they bring those discussions to a wider audience. Question and answer sessions at the conference were necessarily short and a few speakers delivered abbreviated remarks; this volume restores a number of omissions, and provides additional answers to some pertinent questions put by the audience. The Center hopes to encourage the serious problem-solving these complex issues demand. Far too much time has been spent trying to fix the blame.

The library, for a student of foreign things, is normally a sine qua non; for the work of U.S. scholars and students in Japanese studies, the collections surveyed here are a fundamental resource. Universities and centers sponsoring Japanese studies ought therefore to pay special attention to improving and maintaining them, and this publication represents part of the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies\' effort toward that end.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Two surveys of note have considered academic programs on Japan at U.S. colleges and universities. The first, under the auspices of SSRC-ACLS, was published in 1970; the second, prepared for the Subcommittee of Japanese studies of the American Panel of CULCON, was published in 1977. Neither was directed particularly at the library collections supporting the programs, although both pointed to the importance of such holdings.

The defeat and foreign occupation had posed again the painful dilemma: how to be both Japanese and modern, or in postwar terms, how to recover a healthy pride in one\'s national and cultural heritage while living with the radical changes imposed by American military fiat. To many, Uchimura had shown how one could be a patriot and a very \"Japanese\" person who maintained pride in his own cultural tradition while being loyal to a set of values derived from Christianity. This appealed emotionally to the Japanese who had been force-fed through education and the mass media as a massive dose of Americanism. Perhaps through Uchimura\'s experience they too could learn how to live with pride and confidence in a Japan being transformed by outside forces.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The authors of the following essays are representative of the current scholarship on Uchimura and his Japanese Christianity known as Mukyokai. As their footnotes indicate, several of them have recently completed substantial studies dealing with Uchimura--Ota, Ohara, Hirakawa, and Lee critical biographies, and Caldarola a sociological analysis of Mukyokai. The essays presented here give a good sense of the richness and variety of the studies and interpretations that have become available in recent years. Several of the essays raise questions about Uchimura\'s view of his society and his strongly ambivalent feelings about the west. While confirming his stubborn independence, they suggest that his actions were often those of one deeply alienated from both the cultures of which he was part. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">No set of relatively brief papers can hope to capture the full complexity of Uchimura and his thought. The purpose of these essays is not to offer a general interpretation but simply to suggest the rich variety that is possible. If they succeed in that modest aim, they will nonetheless have made a contribution to a better understanding of Uchimura and his role in the history of Japanese-American cultural relations.

Part One studies the structure of Edo kabuki. The first chapter, which outlines that structure, is based for the most part on writings of the Tokugawa period. The second chapter then looks at the concepts of sekai, \"tradition,\" and shuko, \"innovation.\" Kabuki was the product of material that had become a familiar part of Japanese culture by repeated use and dramatization over long periods of time, starting before kabuki began, and material that was relatively new and was used to transform the older, set material. The double identity in Sukeroku came about as a result of this interplay between what was received by way of traditional and what was added by way of innovation.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Part Two considers the significance of the double identity. The author concludes that Sukeroku\'s double identity gave Edo audiences a hero who was an idealization of the contemporary Tokugawa townsman and at the same time a transformation of a samurai god-hero of the past. The first chapter of Part Two traces the development of Sukeroku\'s Soga Goro/samurai identity, from its origins in the early dramatic forms of no, kowaka, and ko-joruri, to the representation of Soga Goro in kabuki by Ichikawa Danjuro I. The seconds then looks at the transformation of Soga Gorointo Sukeroku by discussing the origins of Sukeroku and its introductions to Edo kabuki by Ichikawa Danjuro I and his son, Danjuro II, since their work was the basis of all later developments. </p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',112,6,2,7),(282,'Industry at the Crossroads',NULL,NULL,'Industry at the Crossroads','<p class=\"Keynote\">Proceedings from the second U.S.-Japan Automotive Conference, 1982<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"></b></p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">The mood of the first U of M U.S.-Japan Auto conference in January 1981 could only be described as electric.

One left the conference with a sense that there was a call for action, a mandate to address the problems facing industry.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The mood, about a year later, at the March 1982 U.S.-Japan Auto Conference was far more subdued. While undoubtedly this reflected the stream of statistics confirming the continually depressed state of the industry, another dynamic was possibly operating as well. Whereas the 1981 conference was \"electric,\" a state of mind which flowed from a certain frustration at seemingly overwhelming difficulties and often vague expectations of what we might learn from the Japanese, the 1982 conference was more \"workmanlike\" in the sense that speakers discussed specifically what progress was being made in addressing problems. This more subdued, pragmatic approach continued throughout wand was reinforced by workshops held the day after the main conference. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Instead of discussing the virtues of the Just-In-Time system in Japan, speakers addressed the practical problems of introducing such a system in the U.S. firms. Instead of railing about the benefits or failings of regulation of the industry, they discussed what we could reasonably expect from regulation. Instead of exhorting the industry to adopt Japanese practices willy-nilly, they focused on some of the limitations of the Japanese model in a range of different areas. Instead of trying to identify some magic key to Japanese success in the automotive industry, they discussed the interrelationships among various factors.

When he finally began a closer study of the subject, he made it a practice to keep a file of all Western references. As the file grew in size, if compiled thoroughly and systematically, a bibliography of this kind could be quite valuable for Western scholars and students. For, although many scholars of various disciplines are interested in the New Religions, few of them are able to read the Japanese materials on the subject.

A hamlet is fundamentally a nexus for the organization of productive exchange among member households, the form of exchange through which two or more parties actively combine their resources to produce something of value not available, or as cheaply available, to any of them separately. Defection from productive exchange agreements by hamlet members is reduced by making access to future valuable transactions and corporate property contingent upon the integrity of each current exchange transaction. This method of combining a common interest in production with contingent access to productive resources is termed mutual investment and is the major source of consensus in hamlet decision making. When only cooperate resources are at issue, decisions regularly result in unanimity. When a course of action can be implemented only if hamlet members relinquish control over individually held resources, a division will emerge among the membership. Whether or not a formal vote is taken, the distribution of differing opinion will be known through more informal means of communication. In all cases of division, by the time the course of action to be implemented is formally announced, the minority in opposition will be extremely small. The question then must be resolved whether those in the minority will participate in the implementation or resign as hamlet members. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"background:white;mso-highlight:white\">This book is written with two rather disparate audiences in mind: readers interested primarily in exchange and decision-making phenomenon, on the one hand, and readers interested primarily in the unity of experience represented by the Japanese sensibility, on the other. </p>',192,11,2,7),(287,'\"The Sting of Death\" and Other Stories',NULL,NULL,'\"The Sting of Death\" and Other Stories','<p class=\"Keynote\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"background:white;mso-highlight:white\">A translation of \"The Sting of Death\" and other stories by Japanese short fiction writer Shimao Toshio</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"background:white;mso-highlight:white\">Until a recent \"boom,\" Shimao Toshio, writer of short fiction, critic, and essayist, was not widely known, even in Japan.

Some of his most famous stories-- \"When we Never Left Port,\" for example--have not been included. But the stories presented here do offer a considerable variety of style, from the pristine storybook language of \"The Farthest Edge of the Islands,\" to the young intellectual\'s jargon of \"Everyday Life in a Dream,\" to the visionary, hysterical, occasionally ritualistic prose of the \"sick wife\" stories, to the sober, difficult, almost ponderous narration of \"This Time That Summer.\" Shimao\'s approach to his material varies as well. \"Everyday Life in a Dream\" is the only representative here of a large number of stories usually called surrealistic by the critics, stories whose plots progress by the logic of dreams. The individual experience of real life are lived through a combination of conscious and unconscious perception. These stories are the least approachable and the least charming to the casual reader, but they serve, among other things, to highlight patterns in the more realistic fiction. \"The Farthest Edge of the Islands\" is a symbolic heightening of reality in another way, a romantic fairy tale beginning at the extremity of experience, at the farthest edge of the world. The other stories are presented as precise, close chronicles of reality by a participant in that reality whose attention never waivers and who never allows himself to avert his eyes from a world that he sees as his responsibility and in a sense his fault. All but the first story, \"The Farthest Edge of the Islands,\" which is in third-person narration, are told in the first person by the character who plays Shimao\'s role in the life that inspired the fiction. </p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',200,12,2,7),(288,'American Automobile Industry','The','Rebirth or Requiem?','The American Automobile Industry: Rebirth or Requiem?','<p class=\"Keynote\">Proceedings from the fourth U.S.-Japan Automotive Conference, 1984</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"background:white;mso-highlight:white\">Amid the gloom, indeed the despair, that prevailed among auto industry spokesman during early 1981, the University of Michigan held the first U.S.-Japan Auto Conference. With all the uncertainty that accompanies a march into new territory, the conference very much resembled a call to arms as industry, union, and government officials sought to comprehend and respond to the Japanese challenge. In the subsequent two conferences in 1982 and 1983, the concerned parties displayed an impressive willingness to roll up their sleeves and get on with creating the conditions for a renewal of the industry. Yet success seemed to elude their efforts, and frustrations mounted as the national recession lengthened and deepened. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"background:white;mso-highlight:white\">It was not until the March 1984 conference that definite change in tone became apparent. By this time, it was clear that the industry was beginning to reap the fruits of its efforts. As Paul McCracken notes in his remarks, the market for new cars was manifesting its traditional high-geared response to improved business conditions, and the voluntary trade restraints were contributing to the ability of the industry to take advantage of this renewed prosperity. In addition, those who know the industry well knew that the major improvements in quality and productivity had been made, and many of the changes responsible for these improvements seem unlikely to be reversed. All this was much on the minds of speakers and participants during the March conference. The various speakers presented an image of people who thought that they were pretty much on the way toward addressing successfully their internal problems of productivity, quality, and marketing. All that remained was to dispose of the external factors that prevented the, from competing on that well-known if elusive \"level playing field.\" [ix]</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',112,13,2,7),(289,'Entrepreneurship in a \"Mature Industry\"',NULL,NULL,'Entrepreneurship in a \"Mature Industry\"','<p class=\"Keynote\">Proceedings from the fifth U.S.-Japan Automotive Conference, 1985</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">The fifth annual U.S.-Japan Automotive Industry Conference was held in March 1985, shortly after the Reagan administration decided not to ask Japan to renew the Voluntary Restraint Agreement on auto exports.

Arguably the most important impact of the Japanese challenge to Detroit was a sudden loss of complacency, a realization that the old ways would no longer be enough. A \"mature\" industry was suddenly thrust back into adolescence. The response was a surge of entrepreneurial behavior, not just the individual flamboyance of a Lee Iacocca, but a host of innovations in product, manufacturing, internal organization, and relationships between OEMs and suppliers. This new attention to entrepreneurship certainly continues today, as it must if the American industry is to prosper in the face of inevitably intensifying competition from Japanese companies, not to mention the Koreans and perhaps others. </p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',144,14,2,7),(290,'Japanese Competition','The','Phase 2','The Japanese Competition: Phase 2','<p class=\"Keynote\">Proceedings from the sixth U.S.-Japan Automotive Industry Conference, 1986</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">The sixth U.S.-Japan Automotive Industry Conference had as its theme the competitive implications of Japanese car makers\' establishing a major manufacturing presence here in North America.

Consider, for example, just three of the changes that took place in the United States. First, Ford Motor Company returned a greater profit than General Motors for the first time in sixty years. Second, American Motors, the last of the small, independent automakers, was absorbed by Chrysler. And finally, Honda announced American capacity plans that may conceivably enable it to vault unto Big Three status by the 1990s.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Nor is the pace of change likely to diminish much in the future. On the contrary, it is generally conceded that the global automotive industry is afflicted with enough overcapacity that the next economic downturn will inevitably lead to dislocations extending far beyond the industry itself. The problem we face is that the answer to the question posed by the 1997 Auto Conference is a stark one: No, there is not enough business to go around.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Indeed, the answer to this question is so clear that the Conference\'s speakers quickly moved onto the next question of how the industry might reasonably respond to the troublesome future it faces. The perspectives they offered were varied. Richard Schonberger advocated a more coherent manufacturing strategy; E. Michael Mutchler stressed the importance of technology and of tough decisions on what parts of one\'s business were viable; Douglas Fraser spoke of the need to deal equitably with labor; Ariyoshi Okumura dwelt on product differentiation and a renewed emphasis on excellence in manufacturing; Stephen Doblin advocated the creative use of strategic alliances; and John Betti dwelt on the role of marketing.</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',128,16,2,7),(292,'Protohistoric Yamato',NULL,'Archaeology of the First Japanese State','Protohistoric Yamato: Archaeology of the First Japanese State','<p class=\"Keynote\">An interesting and pioneering study of early state emergence in the Nara Basin</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">Nara is located in the center of what is known today as the Kinai region of Japan.

The name Yamato, presented above variously as a provincial unit (corresponding to the present-day Nara Prefecture), or geographical unit (the Nara Basin only), is also sometimes expanded and applied on a regional scale to mean the Kinai region.

These mysteries are entailed in the earliest recorded history of Japan--references to Japanese island \"countries\" and \"queens\" in the Chinese dynastic histories of the third to fifth centuries A.D., and references to \"kings\" and \"emperors\" in two late fifth- to early sixth-century sword inscriptions and in the extant chronicles of Japan compiled in the early eighth century. </p>',496,17,2,7),(293,'Auto Industry Ahead','The','Who\'s Driving?','The Auto Industry Ahead: Who\'s Driving?','<p class=\"Keynote\">Proceedings from the eighth in a series of U.S.-Japan auto conferences, renamed the University of Michigan International Automotive Industry Conference</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">By 1981, when the First U.S.-Japan Automotive Industry Conference was held, the Ame5rican auto industry was already strongly influenced by global trends. The second oil crisis, and the soaring gas prices that it produced, had made Japan\'s small, energy-efficient cars more attractive to American consumers than they ever had been in the past, and a surge of imports had cut deeply into the market share of America\'s Big Three. Coupled with the broader impact of a global recession, this loss of sales produced a crisis that nearly destroyed Chrysler, and whose impact on Ford was only slightly less severe. Indeed, had it not been for the fact that Ford\'s European operations remained profitable, Ford might have shared Chrysler\'s desperation.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">In recent years, however, the crisis atmosphere has lessened, the character of the Japanese challenge has broadened to include onshore manufacturers as well as imports, and a host of new international competitors has risen to challenge what once seemed the unassailable dominance of the Big Three.

This was a time of great change in all areas of Japanese life: old centralized political establishments were giving way to new provincial powers, the growth of urban centers was causing changes in trade patterns and financial institutions, and everywhere the economy was creating new centers of wealth and influence. In such an age of vitality all patterns of production and consumption were affected, including those involving the arts. </p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">But how and under what specific conditions did these changes take place?

Masked performance may also be powerfully linked to rituals of healing, which aim at freeing the self from states of blockage, isolation, and possession. Taken together, the essays offer an initial grammar of South Indian masking as the culture-specific formation of visible surfaces in which primary issues of identity, self-knowledge, and perception are brought into play. Masking thus implies meta-psychological perspectives on the notions of self, face, and maturation and on the internal economy of the mind in cultures far removed from standard Western psychological paradigms.</p>',288,NULL,3,NULL),(305,'Train that Had Wings','The','Selected Stories of M.

The catalyst for this reformation of indigenous thought was the rise of a small clique of Buddhist monks and lay people from the frontier to commanding positions in the state and monastic order over the course of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This clique had a major influence on the creation of state myths, the ways in which the throne ruled and presented itself, and, ultimately, the relationship between the throne and the state. The new state and monastic orthodoxy, however, was challenged by other Burmese literati, who, over the course of the nineteenth century, sought in Western science, technology, and political theory other ways in which to shape Burmese perspectives on state and society.

We had not planned a study of the diffusion of news events and villagers\' reactions to them. However, the Indian Government was considering the use of media for a major mass communication program, to propagate the idea of having small families through the use of family planning methods, and we believed it would be of value to examine any data that might be helpful in getting at least some feeling about what villagers read in the papers and what they heard on the radio, as well as their understanding of the information and their attitudes toward it. We subsequently asked questions about the use of mass media.

As a result, questions were prepared to determine aspects of attitudes and practices regarding family planning. One of the objectives of the family planning phase of the study was to examine motivational determinants for high and low fertility attitudes. Since husband-wife communication is an important factor in adoption or non-adoption of a fertility control method, the available data on this aspect were also examined.

The product of this effort, as it is encompassed in this volume, is not an attempt at the definitive study of any of the topics. It is rather a series of speculations on the directions feasible for the further study of the Southeast Asian past. As such, the answers proposed in these essays are really questions. Are the ideas presented here true within the specific historical contexts for which they have been developed? If so, can we use these ideas, or variations of them, to interpret the history of other parts of Southeast Asia? If not, what other ideas may be brought to bear on these situations in order to understand them? The ultimate aim of this volume is thus a challenge to the profession at large not only to criticize what we have done, but also to go beyond our postulations and create new ones. </p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',350,11,6,8),(323,'Socialization of Family Size Values','The','Youth and Family Planning in an Indian Village','The Socialization of Family Size Values: Youth and Family Planning in an Indian Village',NULL,'<p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert keynote]</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Most population education programs in India have been based on the assumption that children at all ages can learn about population related matters in school which will modify later fertility behavior. Yet, as is illustrated in this monograph, the most important learning regarding fertility behavior may be unrelated to any school activity and an understanding of the nature of this learning can be useful to program planners.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The present research approaches the problem from the standpoint of the socialization of youth. Socialization is not only the preparation of youth to perform traditional roles but also the teaching of new roles which are necessary as a result of changes affecting the society. It is the consistency with which roles are performed from one generation to the next that maintains established social structure and much has been made of the need to change the structure of peasant societies if fertility is to be changed. A focus on the role of socialization may help assess the extent to which social change is taking place.

The dynamics of this interaction are of particular interest in South and Southeast Asia where oral performance and written traditions share a long, interwoven history. Their continuing, complex interactions challenge earlier studies of orality and literacy, which assumed a clear distinction between the two.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">The essays taken together also address how conceptions of the epics and their textual boundaries may differ between the two regions, where their status as ritual and religious texts varies. Perhaps now, more than ever, the boundaries of epic traditions are in a state of flux, contracting or expanding as South and Southeast Asian societies respond to increasing access to modern education, print technology, and electronic media.</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',171,35,3,8),(347,'Exemplar of Americanism',NULL,'The Philippine Career of Dean C.

Worcester first visited the Philippines as a junior member of a scientific expedition in 1887. He died there, a wealthy businessman, in 1924. One of only a handful of Americans with first-hand experience in the archipelago at the onset of the Spanish-American War, he was appointed to the First Philippine Commission, charged with the civil administration of the new American colony. He thus embarked upon a long and controversial Philippine career, embracing in time the varied roles of government official, scientist, writer, propagandist, and entrepreneur.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">In many ways Worcester typified the American colonial mission. He was talented, pragmatic, tireless, unquestioning, and ruthless in the pursuit of what he considered right. Heralded for nearly two decades as America\'s foremost expert on the Philippines, he was scathingly critical of Filipino society and its values, unable to comprehend the validity of a culture that did not conform to an American ideal. Described by more than one of his countrymen as an \"exemplar\" of Americanism, a colonial statesman making \"lasting contributions to mankind,\" from the Filipino perspective he represented merely the \"immovable column\" of a \"hypocritical foreign administration.\"</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',439,36,6,8),(348,'Paninian Studies',NULL,'Professor S.

Gedney, the preeminent authority on Tai languages and literatures, conducted extensive investigations into a large number of Tai dialects. Employing careful and exhaustive elicitation techniques, he compiled glossaries, texts, and cultural notes from hitherto undescribed, or poorly described, dialects and languages. One of the most extensive is Yay, a language belonging to the Northern Branch of the Tai family, spoken in northern Vietnam and southern China.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Gedney\'s work on Yay, published in this volume, consists of a lengthy glossary and a collection of folktales and traditional songs. The latter texts are reproduced with interlinear glosses and free translations.

Gedney is Lungming, a Tai dialect spoken in and around the town of Lungming, in Kwangsi, China. In addition to compiling the massive glossary published in this volume, Gedney elicited several thousand Lungming sentences. Also reproduced and translated, these serve to illustrate syntactic patterns and vocabulary items. Combined in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The Tai Dialect of Lungming</i>, these data represent one of the most complete examinations yet undertaken of a dialect belonging to the Central Branch of the Tai language family.

This period of violent maneuvering between the Communists, Karen, Chin, Kachin, People\'s Volunteer Organizations, and army and local police units brought Burma to the verge of fragmentation. When the town of Yamethin was cut off from government support in 1949, Singh cleverly used his ties within the community to unite the people. Altogether, the memoir documents how personal relationships and loyalties between individuals were frequently key factors affecting the local balance of power. This graphic and lively eye-witness account reveals how the major political events discussed in standard histories actually unfolded away from the centers of power.</p> <p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert author bio]</p>',180,40,6,8),(352,'Saek Language','The','Glossary, Texts, and Translations','The Saek Language: Glossary, Texts, and Translations',NULL,'<p class=\"Toreview\">[Insert keynote]</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Little research had been conducted on Saek, a Tai-family language spoken by the Saek people of Laos and Thailand, until the preeminent linguist William J.

Never before published, Gedney\'s field data on Saek are collected here, including a 550-page glossary and 450 pages of Saek oral literature presented in free translation and linear glosses. The volume concludes with two important, previously unpublished Gedney papers, \"Saek Final-L: Archaism or Innovation?\" and \"The Twelve Year Names in Saek.\"</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">While William J. Gedney\'s \"The Saek Language\" offers a particularly rich vein of primary data to specialists in comparative Tai, its texts—ranging from oral histories and descriptions of Saek life to folktales—are also of value to historians, anthropologists, and folklorists.

Working in Thailand, Laos, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, he recorded word lists, folktales, stories, and songs. From this early work come the data in this volume, including White Tai, Red Tai, Black Tai, Tai Nuea, Hsi Paw Shan, Chinese Shan, Khuen, and Yong.

This classification has been widely accepted and the three groups are roughly comparable in size and are distinguished by marked differences. William J. Gedney, however, believes that it is a mistake to infer a simultaneous three-way branching of the Tai linguistic family tree. . . . Nevertheless, Gedney concurs that Li\'s three-way grouping, while perhaps not an accurate reflectoin of the real genetic picture, remains useful for practical purposes and is therefore followed in this volume.

Using several informants, including the former ruling prince of Sipsongpanna, Gedney compiled a massive glossary of words, phrases, sentences, proverbs, and song fragments. In addition, he elicited three lengthy texts dealing with the birth of the Buddha.

Initially working on the Southwestern Branch and then moving on to the Central Branch of the family, Gedney worked in Thailand, Laos, and Hong Kong, recording wordlists, folktales, and songs. All of these early data can be found in this volume, including the dialects of Chieng Mai, Nakhorn Phanom, Nyo, Vientiane, Phu Thai, Roi-Et, Loei, Ko Samuy, and Ubon. Also included are the little studied Central Tai dialects found in northern Vietnam and southern China from such sites as Ha Giang, Po Muc, Lang Soen, Bac Va, and Yen Binh.

Gedney has devoted his scholarly research to an in depth exploration and recording of Tai languages and dialects. These endeavors have resulted in numerous scholarly papers and seven lengthy volumes devoted to Tai languages and dialects. Models of clarity and precision, Gedney\'s studies have helped to establish the field of historical comparative Tai studies. What is not so well known is his contribution to folklore, translation, and literature. This volume, William J. Gedney\'s Thai and Indic Literary Studies, remedies that situation. In this volume, Gedney discusses Thai Riddles, problems in translating Thai poetry, and historical development and Sanskrit influences in Thai verse forms. The papers in this volume with their insights and new interpretations will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of Thai literature and its history. </p>',155,46,6,8),(358,'Samskrta-Subodhini',NULL,'A Sanskrit Primer','Samskrta-Subodhini: A Sanskrit Primer','<p class=\"Keynote\">A quintessential guidebook for learning Sanskrit</p>','<p class=\"Bkdesc\">Samskrta-Subodhini: A Sanskrit Primer marks the culmination of Professor Deshpande\'s experience of teaching Sanskrit at the University of Michigan for over twenty-five years. Tested in classes at Michigan and elsewhere and successively improved for over twenty years, the teaching materials in the book now offer an effective tool to learn and teach Sanskrit. It aims at teaching Sanskrit as a language, rather than as a religious or mystical entity. It also simplifies the process of learning Sanskrit by dissociating this language-learning process from the heavy burdens imposed both by the tradition of Indo-European linguistics and the tradition of indigenous Sanskrit grammarians in India. By treating Sanskrit as a productive language, rather than as a dead language merely to be deciphered, the book represents a significant advance over the traditional Western approach to the study of Sanskrit.</p> <p class=\"Bkdesc\">Work on this book began in 1976, and now almost two generations of Professor Deshpande\'s students have used successively improved versions. The book\'s examples include many modified versions of classical Sanskrit passages from epic texts such as The Mahabharata and The Ramayana. The book also contains examples from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions, as well as samples of Sanskrit poetry and satire.\"</p>',504,47,3,8),(359,'Journey','The','Stories by K. C.

The characters are mainly middle class, making them more accessible to North American readers than other examples of contemporary Indian fiction. These are not simple stories. They are about \"divides,\" about gaps between realities and imagination. In complex shifts between direct dialogue, interior monologue, and interior or imagined dialogue, Das lovingly but mercilessly exposes his characters\' thoughts, self-deceptions, and the games they play with each other. These are stories about human weaknesses, the fallibility of human relationships, and the strategies we adopt to cope with our failures.
